| **[Universal randomised signatures for generative time series modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10214v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomised signature has been proposed as a flexible and easily implementable alternative to the well-established path signature. In this article, we employ randomised signature to introduce a generative model for financial time series data in the spirit of reservoir computing. Specifically, we propose a novel Wasserstein-type distance based on discrete-time randomised signatures. This metric on the space of probability measures captures the distance between (conditional) distributions. Its use is justified by our novel universal approximation results for randomised signatures on the space of continuous functions taking the underlying path as an input. We then use our metric as the loss function in a non-adversarial generator model for synthetic time series data based on a reservoir neural stochastic differential equation. We compare the results of our model to benchmarks from the existing literature.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Although transformer-based models have made significant progress in ECG classification, they exhibit inefficiencies in the inference phase. The issue is primarily attributable to the secondary computational complexity of Transformer's self-attention mechanism. particularly when processing lengthy sequences. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, ECGMamba, which employs a bidirectional state-space model (BiSSM) to enhance classification efficiency. ECGMamba is based on the innovative Mamba-based block, which incorporates a range of time series modeling techniques to enhance performance while maintaining the efficiency of inference. The experimental results on two publicly available ECG datasets demonstrate that ECGMamba effectively balances the effectiveness and efficiency of classification, achieving competitive performance. This study not only contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of ECG classification but also provides a new research path for efficient and accurate ECG signal analysis. This is of guiding significance for the development of diagnostic models for cardiovascular diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.17858 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Gut Feel: Using Time Series Transformers to Find Investment Gems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16888v3)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the growing application of data-driven approaches within the Private Equity (PE) industry, particularly in sourcing investment targets (i.e., companies) for Venture Capital (VC) and Growth Capital (GC). We present a comprehensive review of the relevant approaches and propose a novel approach leveraging a Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Classifier (TMTSC) for predicting the success likelihood of any candidate company. The objective of our research is to optimize sourcing performance for VC and GC investments by formally defining the sourcing problem as a multivariate time series classification task. We consecutively introduce the key components of our implementation which collectively contribute to the successful application of TMTSC in VC/GC sourcing: input features, model architecture, optimization target, and investor-centric data processing. Our extensive experiments on two real-world investment tasks, benchmarked towards three popular baselines, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving decision making within the VC and GC industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by ICANN (33rd International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks) 2024 as full paper (15 pages and 7 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Graphical Linear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03210v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series datasets are central in machine learning with applications in numerous fields of science and engineering, such as biomedicine, Earth observation, and network analysis. Extensive research exists on state-space models (SSMs), which are powerful mathematical tools that allow for probabilistic and interpretable learning on time series. Learning the model parameters in SSMs is arguably one of the most complicated tasks, and the inclusion of prior knowledge is known to both ease the interpretation but also to complicate the inferential tasks. Very recent works have attempted to incorporate a graphical perspective on some of those model parameters, but they present notable limitations that this work addresses. More generally, existing graphical modeling tools are designed to incorporate either static information, focusing on statistical dependencies among independent random variables (e.g., graphical Lasso approach), or dynamic information, emphasizing causal relationships among time series samples (e.g., graphical Granger approaches). However, there are no joint approaches combining static and dynamic graphical modeling within the context of SSMs. This work proposes a novel approach to fill this gap by introducing a joint graphical modeling framework that bridges the graphical Lasso model and a causal-based graphical approach for the linear-Gaussian SSM. We present DGLASSO (Dynamic Graphical Lasso), a new inference method within this framework that implements an efficient block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm. The algorithm's convergence is established by departing from modern tools from nonlinear analysis. Experimental validation on various synthetic data showcases the effectiveness of the proposed model and inference algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabularFM: An Open Framework For Tabular Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09837v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models (FMs), pretrained on extensive datasets using self-supervised techniques, are capable of learning generalized patterns from large amounts of data. This reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets for each new task, saving both time and resources by leveraging the broad knowledge base established during pretraining. Most research on FMs has primarily focused on unstructured data, such as text and images, or semi-structured data, like time-series. However, there has been limited attention to structured data, such as tabular data, which, despite its prevalence, remains under-studied due to a lack of clean datasets and insufficient research on the transferability of FMs for various tabular data tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce a framework called TabularFM (\url{https://tabularfm.github.io/}), which incorporates state-of-the-art methods for developing FMs specifically for tabular data. This includes variations of neural architectures such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers. We have curated a million of tabular datasets and released cleaned versions to facilitate the development of tabular FMs. We pretrained FMs on this curated data, benchmarked various learning methods on these datasets, and released the pretrained models along with leaderboards for future comparative studies. Our fully open-sourced system provides a comprehensive analysis of the transferability of tabular FMs. By releasing these datasets, pretrained models, and leaderboards, we aim to enhance the validity and usability of tabular FMs in the near future.</p></details> |  |

While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior. This aspect becomes particularly critical when the monitored system is deployed in a vital environment. In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, + Supplemental Materials, Accepted at ECML PKDD 2024 (European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases)</p></details> |
| **[Fredformer: Frequency Debiased Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09009v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs. The code is available at: https://github.com/chenzRG/Fredformer</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGKDD2024</p></details> |
| **[TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01638v3)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of scalable mobile sensing has led to large amounts of time series data for real-world applications. A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep learning for precipitation nowcasting: A survey from the perspective of time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04867v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based time series forecasting has dominated the short-term precipitation forecasting field with the help of its ability to estimate motion flow in high-resolution datasets. The growing interest in precipitation nowcasting offers substantial opportunities for the advancement of current forecasting technologies. Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of in-depth surveys of time series precipitation forecasting using deep learning. Thus, this paper systemically reviews recent progress in time series precipitation forecasting models. Specifically, we investigate the following key points within background components, covering: i) preprocessing, ii) objective functions, and iii) evaluation metrics. We then categorize forecasting models into \textit{recursive} and \textit{multiple} strategies based on their approaches to predict future frames, investigate the impacts of models using the strategies, and performance assessments. Finally, we evaluate current deep learning-based models for precipitation forecasting on a public benchmark, discuss their limitations and challenges, and present some promising research directions. Our contribution lies in providing insights for a better understanding of time series precipitation forecasting and in aiding the development of robust AI solutions for the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Decoder: Towards Training Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09643v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural network-based sequence-to-sequence models have been extensively applied for multi-step-ahead time series forecasting. These models typically involve a decoder trained using either its previous forecasts or the actual observed values as the decoder inputs. However, relying on self-generated predictions can lead to the rapid accumulation of errors over multiple steps, while using the actual observations introduces exposure bias as these values are unavailable during the extrapolation stage. In this regard, this study proposes a novel training approach called reinforced decoder, which introduces auxiliary models to generate alternative decoder inputs that remain accessible when extrapolating. Additionally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to dynamically select the optimal inputs to improve accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms representative training methods over several datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach also exhibits promising performance when generalized to self-attention-based sequence-to-sequence forecasting models.</p></details> | 12 pages,8 figures |
| **[Changes by Butterflies: Farsighted Forecasting with Group Reservoir Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09573v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Chaos, a minor divergence between two initial conditions exhibits exponential amplification over time, leading to far-away outcomes, known as the butterfly effect. Thus, the distant future is full of uncertainty and hard to forecast. We introduce Group Reservoir Transformer to predict long-term events more accurately and robustly by overcoming two challenges in Chaos: (1) the extensive historical sequences and (2) the sensitivity to initial conditions. A reservoir is attached to a Transformer to efficiently handle arbitrarily long historical lengths, with an extension of a group of reservoirs to reduce the sensitivity to the initialization variations. Our architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in multivariate time series, including TimeLLM, GPT2TS, PatchTST, DLinear, TimeNet, and the baseline Transformer, with an error reduction of up to -59\% in various fields such as ETTh, ETTm, and air quality, demonstrating that an ensemble of butterfly learning can improve the adequacy and certainty of event prediction, despite of the traveling time to the unknown future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning with little mixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08269v3)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study square loss in a realizable time-series framework with martingale difference noise. Our main result is a fast rate excess risk bound which shows that whenever a trajectory hypercontractivity condition holds, the risk of the least-squares estimator on dependent data matches the iid rate order-wise after a burn-in time. In comparison, many existing results in learning from dependent data have rates where the effective sample size is deflated by a factor of the mixing-time of the underlying process, even after the burn-in time. Furthermore, our results allow the covariate process to exhibit long range correlations which are substantially weaker than geometric ergodicity. We call this phenomenon learning with little mixing, and present several examples for when it occurs: bounded function classes for which the $L^2$ and $L^{2+\epsilon}$ norms are equivalent, ergodic finite state Markov chains, various parametric models, and a broad family of infinite dimensional $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ ellipsoids. By instantiating our main result to system identification of nonlinear dynamics with generalized linear model transitions, we obtain a nearly minimax optimal excess risk bound after only a polynomial burn-in time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise analysis of ridge interpolators under heavy correlations -- a Random Duality Theory view](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09199v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider fully row/column-correlated linear regression models and study several classical estimators (including minimum norm interpolators (GLS), ordinary least squares (LS), and ridge regressors). We show that \emph{Random Duality Theory} (RDT) can be utilized to obtain precise closed form characterizations of all estimators related optimizing quantities of interest, including the \emph{prediction risk} (testing or generalization error). On a qualitative level out results recover the risk's well known non-monotonic (so-called double-descent) behavior as the number of features/sample size ratio increases. On a quantitative level, our closed form results show how the risk explicitly depends on all key model parameters, including the problem dimensions and covariance matrices. Moreover, a special case of our results, obtained when intra-sample (or time-series) correlations are not present, precisely match the corresponding ones obtained via spectral methods in [6,16,17,24].</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series Forecasting for Out-of-Distribution Generalization Using Invariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09130v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF. To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Time Elastic Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17516v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zoom and Shift are All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08866v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature alignment serves as the primary mechanism for fusing multimodal data. We put forth a feature alignment approach that achieves full integration of multimodal information. This is accomplished via an alternating process of shifting and expanding feature representations across modalities to obtain a consistent unified representation in a joint feature space. The proposed technique can reliably capture high-level interplay between features originating from distinct modalities. Consequently, substantial gains in multimodal learning performance are attained. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other prevalent multimodal fusion schemes on a range of tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation conducted on multimodal datasets comprising time series, image, and text demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Evidentially Calibrated Source-Free Time-Series Domain Adaptation with Temporal Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02635v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model pre-trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data, preserving the source domain's privacy. While SFDA is prevalent in computer vision, it remains largely unexplored in time series analysis. Existing SFDA methods, designed for visual data, struggle to capture the inherent temporal dynamics of time series, hindering adaptation performance. This paper proposes MAsk And imPUte (MAPU), a novel and effective approach for time series SFDA. MAPU addresses the critical challenge of temporal consistency by introducing a novel temporal imputation task. This task involves randomly masking time series signals and leveraging a dedicated temporal imputer to recover the original signal within the learned embedding space, bypassing the complexities of noisy raw data. Notably, MAPU is the first method to explicitly address temporal consistency in the context of time series SFDA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with existing SFDA methods, providing greater flexibility. We further introduce E-MAPU, which incorporates evidential uncertainty estimation to address the overconfidence issue inherent in softmax predictions. To achieve that, we leverage evidential deep learning to obtain a better-calibrated pre-trained model and adapt the target encoder to map out-of-support target samples to a new feature representation closer to the source domain's support. This fosters better alignment, ultimately enhancing adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world time series datasets demonstrate that both MAPU and E-MAPU achieve significant performance gains compared to existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for tackling various time series domain adaptation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Knowledge Pruning for Time Series Data Analytics on Edge-computing Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08765v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limited by the scale and diversity of time series data, the neural networks trained on time series data often overfit and show unsatisfacotry performances. In comparison, large language models (LLMs) recently exhibit impressive generalization in diverse fields. Although massive LLM based approaches are proposed for time series tasks, these methods require to load the whole LLM in both training and reference. This high computational demands limit practical applications in resource-constrained settings, like edge-computing and IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Pruning (KP), a novel paradigm for time series learning in this paper. For a specific downstream task, we argue that the world knowledge learned by LLMs is much redundant and only the related knowledge termed as "pertinent knowledge" is useful. Unlike other methods, our KP targets to prune the redundant knowledge and only distill the pertinent knowledge into the target model. This reduces model size and computational costs significantly. Additionally, different from existing LLM based approaches, our KP does not require to load the LLM in the process of training and testing, further easing computational burdens. With our proposed KP, a lightweight network can effectively learn the pertinent knowledge, achieving satisfactory performances with a low computation cost. To verify the effectiveness of our KP, two fundamental tasks on edge-computing devices are investigated in our experiments, where eight diverse environments or benchmarks with different networks are used to verify the generalization of our KP. Through experiments, our KP demonstrates effective learning of pertinent knowledge, achieving notable performance improvements in regression (19.7% on average) and classification (up to 13.7%) tasks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Prediction Risk and Estimation Risk of the Ridgeless Least Squares Estimator under General Assumptions on Regression Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12883v3)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a significant growth in research focusing on minimum $\ell_2$ norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimators. However, the majority of these analyses have been limited to an unrealistic regression error structure, assuming independent and identically distributed errors with zero mean and common variance. In this paper, we explore prediction risk as well as estimation risk under more general regression error assumptions, highlighting the benefits of overparameterization in a more realistic setting that allows for clustered or serial dependence. Notably, we establish that the estimation difficulties associated with the variance components of both risks can be summarized through the trace of the variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors. Our findings suggest that the benefits of overparameterization can extend to time series, panel and grouped data.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Time-MMD: A New Multi-Domain Multimodal Dataset for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08627v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA. The dataset and library are available at https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD and https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM-TSFlib.</p></details> |  |

The study of such properties on dependent data is still a challenge. In this paper, we carry out deep learning from strongly mixing observations, and deal with the squared and a broad class of loss functions. We consider sparse-penalized regularization for deep neural network predictor. For a general framework that includes, regression estimation, classification, time series prediction,$\cdots$, oracle inequality for the expected excess risk is established and a bound on the class of H\"older smooth functions is provided. For nonparametric regression from strong mixing data and sub-exponentially error, we provide an oracle inequality for the $L_2$ error and investigate an upper bound of this error on a class of H\"older composition functions. For the specific case of nonparametric autoregression with Gaussian and Laplace errors, a lower bound of the $L_2$ error on this H\"older composition class is established. Up to logarithmic factor, this bound matches its upper bound; so, the deep neural network estimator attains the minimax optimal rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3)-Equivariant and Noise-Invariant 3D Rigid Motion Tracking in Brain MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13534v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigid motion tracking is paramount in many medical imaging applications where movements need to be detected, corrected, or accounted for. Modern strategies rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pose this problem as rigid registration. Yet, CNNs do not exploit natural symmetries in this task, as they are equivariant to translations (their outputs shift with their inputs) but not to rotations. Here we propose EquiTrack, the first method that uses recent steerable SE(3)-equivariant CNNs (E-CNN) for motion tracking. While steerable E-CNNs can extract corresponding features across different poses, testing them on noisy medical images reveals that they do not have enough learning capacity to learn noise invariance. Thus, we introduce a hybrid architecture that pairs a denoiser with an E-CNN to decouple the processing of anatomically irrelevant intensity features from the extraction of equivariant spatial features. Rigid transforms are then estimated in closed-form. EquiTrack outperforms state-of-the-art learning and optimisation methods for motion tracking in adult brain MRI and fetal MRI time series. Our code is available at https://github.com/BBillot/EquiTrack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE transactions on Medical Imaging</p></details> |

Analysing the nodality of British MPs and journalists on Twitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08765v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Who sets the policy agenda? In this paper, we explore the roles of policy actors in agenda setting by studying their relative influence in policy-related discussions. Our approach builds on ``nodality'' \textemdash a concept in political science that determines the capacity of an actor to share information and to be at the centre of information networks. We propose a novel methodology that quantifies the nodality of all individual actors in any conversation by analysing a comprehensive set of their centrality measures in the related information network. We combine this with the analysis of the activity time-series, of the related conversation (or topic), to demonstrate how nodality scores relate to the capacity to drive topic-related activity. Here we analyse policy-related discussions on X (previously Twitter) and quantify the nodality of two sets of actors in the UK political system \textemdash Members of Parliament (MPs) and accredited journalists - on four policy topics: The Russia-Ukraine War, the Cost-of-Living Crisis, Brexit and COVID-19. Our results show that the capacity to influence the activity related to a topic is significantly and positively associated with nodality. In particular, we identify two dimensions of nodality that drive the capacity to influence topic-related activity. The first is ``active nodality", which reflects the level of topic-related engagement an individual actor has on the platform. The second dimension is ``inherent nodality" which is entirely independent of the platform and reflects the actor's institutional position (such as an MP in a front-bench role, or a journalist's position at a prominent media outlet).</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[SOFTS: Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Series-Core Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14197v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, \textit{e.g.}, attention, STAR employs a centralized strategy to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on the quality of each channel. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively.SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAR module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. For further research and development, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the potential of addressing spatial-temporal forecasting problems using general time series forecasting models, i.e., models that do not leverage the spatial relationships among the nodes. We propose a all-Multi-Layer Perceptron (all-MLP) time series forecasting architecture called RPMixer. The all-MLP architecture was chosen due to its recent success in time series forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, our method capitalizes on the ensemble-like behavior of deep neural networks, where each individual block within the network behaves like a base learner in an ensemble model, particularly when identity mapping residual connections are incorporated. By integrating random projection layers into our model, we increase the diversity among the blocks' outputs, thereby improving the overall performance of the network. Extensive experiments conducted on the largest spatial-temporal forecasting benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternative methods, including both spatial-temporal graph models and general forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Sparsity Level during Training for Efficient Time Series Forecasting with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18382v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient time series forecasting has become critical for real-world applications, particularly with deep neural networks (DNNs). Efficiency in DNNs can be achieved through sparse connectivity and reducing the model size. However, finding the sparsity level automatically during training remains challenging due to the heterogeneity in the loss-sparsity tradeoffs across the datasets. In this paper, we propose \enquote{\textbf{P}runing with \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}parsity \textbf{L}evel} (\textbf{PALS}), to automatically seek a decent balance between loss and sparsity, all without the need for a predefined sparsity level. PALS draws inspiration from sparse training and during-training methods. It introduces the novel "expand" mechanism in training sparse neural networks, allowing the model to dynamically shrink, expand, or remain stable to find a proper sparsity level. In this paper, we focus on achieving efficiency in transformers known for their excellent time series forecasting performance but high computational cost. Nevertheless, PALS can be applied directly to any DNN. To this aim, we demonstrate its effectiveness also on the DLinear model. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets and five state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer variants show that PALS substantially reduces model size while maintaining comparable performance to the dense model. More interestingly, PALS even outperforms the dense model, in \textcolor{blue}{12} and \textcolor{blue}{14} cases out of 30 cases in terms of MSE and MAE loss, respectively, while reducing \textcolor{blue}{65\%} parameter count and \textcolor{blue}{63\%} FLOPs on average.

The applicability of quantum simulations and quantum metrology techniques for modelling complex physical systems and achieving high-resolution measurements are proposed. The impacts of various parameter distributions and learning rates on predictive accuracy are investigated. Modelling the time evolution of physical systems Hamiltonian simulation and the product formula procedure are adopted. The time block method is analyzed in order to reduce simulation errors, while the Schatten-infinite norm is used to evaluate the simulation precision. Methodology requires estimation of optimized parameters by minimizing loss functions and resource needs. For this purpose, the mathematical formulations of Cramer Rao Bound and Fischer Information are indispensable requirements. The impact of learning rates on regulating the loss function for various parameter values. Using parameterized quantum circuits, the article outlines a four-step procedure for extracting information. This method involves the preparation of input states, the evolution of parameterized quantum states, the measurement of outputs, and the estimation of parameters based on multiple measurements. The study analyses variational unitary circuits with optimized parameter estimation for more precise predictions. The findings shed light on the effects of normal parameter distributions and learning rates on attaining the most optimal state and comparison with classical Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) predictions, providing valuable insights for the development of more appropriate approaches in quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.05767</p></details> |
| **[CAFO: Feature-Centric Explanation on Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01833v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series (MTS) classification, finding the important features (e.g., sensors) for model performance is crucial yet challenging due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of MTS data, intricate temporal dynamics, and the necessity for domain-specific interpretations. Current explanation methods for MTS mostly focus on time-centric explanations, apt for pinpointing important time periods but less effective in identifying key features. This limitation underscores the pressing need for a feature-centric approach, a vital yet often overlooked perspective that complements time-centric analysis. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel feature-centric explanation and evaluation framework for MTS, named CAFO (Channel Attention and Feature Orthgonalization). CAFO employs a convolution-based approach with channel attention mechanisms, incorporating a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) and a QR decomposition-based loss for promoting feature-wise orthogonality. We demonstrate that this orthogonalization enhances the separability of attention distributions, thereby refining and stabilizing the ranking of feature importance. This improvement in feature-wise ranking enhances our understanding of feature explainability in MTS. Furthermore, we develop metrics to evaluate global and class-specific feature importance. Our framework's efficacy is validated through extensive empirical analyses on two major public benchmarks and real-world datasets, both synthetic and self-collected, specifically designed to highlight class-wise discriminative features. The results confirm CAFO's robustness and informative capacity in assessing feature importance in MTS classification tasks. This study not only advances the understanding of feature-centric explanations in MTS but also sets a foundation for future explorations in feature-centric explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD 2024 Research Track</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average. Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/ClaudiaShu/DeformTime</p></details> |
| **[CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02131v3)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Calibration of Time-Series Forecasting: Detecting and Adapting Context-Driven Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14838v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of introducing deep learning models to time series forecasting. From a data generation perspective, we illustrate that existing models are susceptible to distribution shifts driven by temporal contexts, whether observed or unobserved. Such context-driven distribution shift (CDS) introduces biases in predictions within specific contexts and poses challenges for conventional training paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a universal calibration methodology for the detection and adaptation of CDS with a trained model. To this end, we propose a novel CDS detector, termed the "residual-based CDS detector" or "Reconditionor", which quantifies the model's vulnerability to CDS by evaluating the mutual information between prediction residuals and their corresponding contexts. A high Reconditionor score indicates a severe susceptibility, thereby necessitating model adaptation. In this circumstance, we put forth a straightforward yet potent adapter framework for model calibration, termed the "sample-level contextualized adapter" or "SOLID". This framework involves the curation of a contextually similar dataset to the provided test sample and the subsequent fine-tuning of the model's prediction layer with a limited number of steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this adaptation strategy can achieve an optimal bias-variance trade-off. Notably, our proposed Reconditionor and SOLID are model-agnostic and readily adaptable to a wide range of models. Extensive experiments show that SOLID consistently enhances the performance of current forecasting models on real-world datasets, especially on cases with substantial CDS detected by the proposed Reconditionor, thus validating the effectiveness of the calibration approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD'2...</summary><p>KDD'24 research paper</p></details> |

Neural CDEs (NCDEs) treat time series data as observations from a control path, parameterise a CDE's vector field using a neural network, and use the solution path as a continuously evolving hidden state. As their formulation makes them robust to irregular sampling rates, NCDEs are a powerful approach for modelling real-world data. Building on neural rough differential equations (NRDEs), we introduce Log-NCDEs, a novel, effective, and efficient method for training NCDEs. The core component of Log-NCDEs is the Log-ODE method, a tool from the study of rough paths for approximating a CDE's solution. Log-NCDEs are shown to outperform NCDEs, NRDEs, the linear recurrent unit, S5, and MAMBA on a range of multivariate time series datasets with up to $50{,}000$ observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning 2024</p></details> |

While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is the more expressive model with better predictive performance, we will show that it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: it does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. Also, TACTiS does not provide any guarantees for marginalization consistency. We develop a novel probabilistic irregular time series forecasting model, Marginalization Consistent Mixtures of Separable Flows (moses), that mixes several normalizing flows with (i) Gaussian Processes with full covariance matrix as source distributions and (ii) a separable invertible transformation, aiming to combine the expressivity of normalizing flows with the marginalization consistency of Gaussians. In experiments on four different datasets we show that moses outperforms other state-of-the-art marginalization consistent models, performs on par with ProFITi, but different from ProFITi, guarantee marginalization consistency.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work & Under review; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

This work focuses on estimating the causal effect between two time series, which are confounded by a third, unobserved time series. Assuming spectral sparsity of the confounder, we show how in the frequency domain this problem can be framed as an adversarial outlier problem. We introduce Deconfounding by Robust regression (DecoR), a novel approach that estimates the causal effect using robust linear regression in the frequency domain. Considering two different robust regression techniques, we first improve existing bounds on the estimation error for such techniques. Crucially, our results do not require distributional assumptions on the covariates. We can therefore use them in time series settings. Applying these results to DecoR, we prove, under suitable assumptions, upper bounds for the estimation error of DecoR that imply consistency. We show DecoR's effectiveness through experiments on synthetic data. Our experiments furthermore suggest that our method is robust with respect to model misspecification.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Low Rank Multi-Dictionary Selection at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06960v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparse dictionary coding framework represents signals as a linear combination of a few predefined dictionary atoms. It has been employed for images, time series, graph signals and recently for 2-way (or 2D) spatio-temporal data employing jointly temporal and spatial dictionaries. Large and over-complete dictionaries enable high-quality models, but also pose scalability challenges which are exacerbated in multi-dictionary settings. Hence, an important problem that we address in this paper is: How to scale multi-dictionary coding for large dictionaries and datasets? We propose a multi-dictionary atom selection technique for low-rank sparse coding named LRMDS. To enable scalability to large dictionaries and datasets, it progressively selects groups of row-column atom pairs based on their alignment with the data and performs convex relaxation coding via the corresponding sub-dictionaries. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that when the data has a low-rank encoding with a sparse subset of the atoms, LRMDS is able to select them with strong guarantees under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability and quality of LRMDS in both synthetic and real-world datasets and for a range of coding dictionaries. It achieves 3X to 10X speed-up compared to baselines, while obtaining up to two orders of magnitude improvement in representation quality on some of the real world datasets given a fixed target number of atoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, August 25--29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |
| **[Nonlinear time-series embedding by monotone variational inequality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06894v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the wild, we often encounter collections of sequential data such as electrocardiograms, motion capture, genomes, and natural language, and sequences may be multichannel or symbolic with nonlinear dynamics. We introduce a new method to learn low-dimensional representations of nonlinear time series without supervision and can have provable recovery guarantees. The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning what to Learn: heterogeneous observations of dynamics and establishing (possibly causal) relations among them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06812v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before we attempt to learn a function between two (sets of) observables of a physical process, we must first decide what the inputs and what the outputs of the desired function are going to be. Here we demonstrate two distinct, data-driven ways of initially deciding ``the right quantities'' to relate through such a function, and then proceed to learn it. This is accomplished by processing multiple simultaneous heterogeneous data streams (ensembles of time series) from observations of a physical system: multiple observation processes of the system. We thus determine (a) what subsets of observables are common between the observation processes (and therefore observable from each other, relatable through a function); and (b) what information is unrelated to these common observables, and therefore particular to each observation process, and not contributing to the desired function. Any data-driven function approximation technique can subsequently be used to learn the input-output relation, from k-nearest neighbors and Geometric Harmonics to Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks. Two particular ``twists'' of the approach are discussed. The first has to do with the identifiability of particular quantities of interest from the measurements. We now construct mappings from a single set of observations of one process to entire level sets of measurements of the process, consistent with this single set. The second attempts to relate our framework to a form of causality: if one of the observation processes measures ``now'', while the second observation process measures ``in the future'', the function to be learned among what is common across observation processes constitutes a dynamical model for the system evolution.</p></details> |  |

This highlights the essential role of sufficient data in training effective models, paralleling the advancements seen in computer vision. Our work delves into adapting and applying existing methods in innovative ways to the domain of multivariate time series classification. Our comprehensive exploration of these techniques sets a new standard for addressing data scarcity in time series analysis, emphasizing that diverse augmentation strategies are crucial for unlocking the potential of both traditional and deep learning models. Moreover, by meticulously analyzing and applying a variety of augmentation techniques, we demonstrate that strategic data enrichment can enhance model accuracy. This not only establishes a benchmark for future research in time series analysis but also underscores the importance of adopting varied augmentation approaches to improve model performance in the face of limited data availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Multivariate Time Series Analytics (MulTiSA), ICDE Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Continuum Attention for Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06486v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which we prove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</p></details> |  |

However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into such tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring. Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3) prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes. For the first task we designed 857 case studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-world scenarios in sleep and fitness. Through comprehensive evaluation of domain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are not statistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while experts remain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvements in using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleep insights. We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleep medicine and fitness examinations. PH-LLM achieved 79% on sleep and 88% on fitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts. Finally, we trained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual and multimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate that multimodal encoding is required to match performance of specialized discriminative models. Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these results demonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and the benefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applications as done with PH-LLM.</p></details> | 72 pages |

In contrast to conventional static image datasets, event-based neuromorphic datasets present heightened complexity in feature extraction due to their distinctive time series and sparsity characteristics, which influences their classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach termed Neuromorphic Momentum Contrast Learning (NeuroMoCo) for SNNs is introduced in this paper by extending the benefits of self-supervised pre-training to SNNs to effectively stimulate their potential. This is the first time that self-supervised learning (SSL) based on momentum contrastive learning is realized in SNNs. In addition, we devise a novel loss function named MixInfoNCE tailored to their temporal characteristics to further increase the classification accuracy of neuromorphic datasets, which is verified through rigorous ablation experiments.

The management of large quantities of time series data presents challenges in terms of deep learning tasks, particularly for training a deep neural network. Recently, a technique named \textit{Dataset Condensation} has emerged as a solution to this problem. This technique generates a smaller synthetic dataset that has comparable performance to the full real dataset in downstream tasks such as classification. However, previous methods are primarily designed for image and graph datasets, and directly adapting them to the time series dataset leads to suboptimal performance due to their inability to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in time series data, particularly in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dataset \textit{\textbf{Cond}}ensation for \textit{\textbf{T}}ime \textit{\textbf{S}}eries \textit{\textbf{C}}lassification via Dual Domain Matching (\textbf{CondTSC}) which focuses on the time series classification dataset condensation task. Different from previous methods, our proposed framework aims to generate a condensed dataset that matches the surrogate objectives in both the time and frequency domains. Specifically, CondTSC incorporates multi-view data augmentation, dual domain training, and dual surrogate objectives to enhance the dataset condensation process in the time and frequency domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms other baselines and learns a condensed synthetic dataset that exhibits desirable characteristics such as conforming to the distribution of the original data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2024 research track</p></details> |

Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small two-layer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture.

| **[Set Features for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14773v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes to use set features for detecting anomalies in samples that consist of unusual combinations of normal elements. Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> |
| **[Event prediction and causality inference despite incomplete information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05893v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explored the challenge of predicting and explaining the occurrence of events within sequences of data points. Our focus was particularly on scenarios in which unknown triggers causing the occurrence of events may consist of non-consecutive, masked, noisy data points. This scenario is akin to an agent tasked with learning to predict and explain the occurrence of events without understanding the underlying processes or having access to crucial information. Such scenarios are encountered across various fields, such as genomics, hardware and software verification, and financial time series prediction. We combined analytical, simulation, and machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate, quantify, and provide solutions to this challenge. We deduced and validated equations generally applicable to any variation of the underlying challenge. Using these equations, we (1) described how the level of complexity changes with various parameters (e.g., number of apparent and hidden states, trigger length, confidence, etc.) and (2) quantified the data needed to successfully train an ML model. We then (3) proved our ML solution learns and subsequently identifies unknown triggers and predicts the occurrence of events. If the complexity of the challenge is too high, our ML solution can identify trigger candidates to be used to interactively probe the system under investigation to determine the true trigger in a way considerably more efficient than brute force methods. By sharing our findings, we aim to assist others grappling with similar challenges, enabling estimates on the complexity of their problem, the data required and a solution to solve it.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This paper proposes adapting an established model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm for short-term load forecasting in the context of few-shot learning. Specifically, the proposed method can rapidly adapt and generalize within any unknown load time series of arbitrary length using only minimal training samples. In this context, the meta-learning model learns an optimal set of initial parameters for a base-level learner recurrent neural network. The proposed model is evaluated using a dataset of historical load consumption data from real-world consumers. Despite the examined load series' short length, it produces accurate forecasts outperforming transfer learning and task-specific machine learning methods by $12.5\%$. To enhance robustness and fairness during model evaluation, a novel metric, mean average log percentage error, is proposed that alleviates the bias introduced by the commonly used MAPE metric. Finally, a series of studies to evaluate the model's robustness under different hyperparameters and time series lengths is also conducted, demonstrating that the proposed approach consistently outperforms all other models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Synthetic datasets have emerged to address these issues. This paradigm relies on generative AI models to generate unbiased, privacy-preserving data while maintaining fidelity to the original data. However, assessing the trustworthiness of synthetic datasets and models is a critical challenge. We introduce a holistic auditing framework that comprehensively evaluates synthetic datasets and AI models. It focuses on preventing bias and discrimination, ensures fidelity to the source data, assesses utility, robustness, and privacy preservation. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by auditing various generative models across diverse use cases like education, healthcare, banking, and human resources, spanning different data modalities such as tabular, time-series, vision, and natural language. This holistic assessment is essential for compliance with regulatory safeguards. We introduce a trustworthiness index to rank synthetic datasets based on their safeguards trade-offs. Furthermore, we present a trustworthiness-driven model selection and cross-validation process during training, exemplified with "TrustFormers" across various data types. This approach allows for controllable trustworthiness trade-offs in synthetic data creation. Our auditing framework fosters collaboration among stakeholders, including data scientists, governance experts, internal reviewers, external certifiers, and regulators. This transparent reporting should become a standard practice to prevent bias, discrimination, and privacy violations, ensuring compliance with policies and providing accountability, safety, and performance guarantees.</p></details> | submitted |

It progresses gradually, often remaining undiagnosed until advanced stages. Early detection is crucial to monitor atrophy and develop treatment strategies to prevent further vision impairment. Data-centric methods have enabled computer-aided algorithms for precise glaucoma diagnosis. In this study, we use deep learning models to identify complex disease traits and progression criteria, detecting subtle changes indicative of glaucoma. We explore the structure-function relationship in glaucoma progression and predict functional impairment from structural eye deterioration. We analyze statistical and machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques with optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for accurate progression prediction. Addressing challenges like age variability, data imbalances, and noisy labels, we develop novel semi-supervised time-series algorithms: 1. Weakly-Supervised Time-Series Learning: We create a CNN-LSTM model to encode spatiotemporal features from OCT scans. This approach uses age-related progression and positive-unlabeled data to establish robust pseudo-progression criteria, bypassing gold-standard labels. 2. Semi-Supervised Time-Series Learning: Using labels from Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) in a contrastive learning scheme, the CNN-LSTM architecture learns from potentially mislabeled data to improve prediction accuracy. Our methods outperform conventional and state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | Dissertation |

In resource-constrained hospital environments, a scalable and unified machine learning framework that improves previous forecast performances could improve hospital operations and save costs. We introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning from tabular, time-series, language, and vision data for supervised binary/multiclass classification, regression, and unsupervised clustering. It features a novel attention mechanism balancing self-exploitation (learning source-task), and cross-exploration (learning cross-tasks), and offers explainability through a proposed TIM score, shedding light on the dynamics of task learning interdependencies. M3H encompasses an unprecedented range of medical tasks and machine learning problem classes and consistently outperforms traditional single-task models by on average 11.6% across 40 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments, three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task. The modular design of the framework ensures its generalizability in data processing, task definition, and rapid model prototyping, making it production ready for both clinical and operational healthcare settings, especially those in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hinge-FM2I: An Approach using Image Inpainting for Interpolating Missing Data in Univariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06631v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasts are crucial for various applications, such as traffic management, electricity consumption, and healthcare. However, limitations in models and data quality can significantly impact forecasts accuracy. One common issue with data quality is the absence of data points, referred to as missing data. It is often caused by sensor malfunctions, equipment failures, or human errors. This paper proposes Hinge-FM2I, a novel method for handling missing data values in univariate time series data. Hinge-FM2I builds upon the strengths of the Forecasting Method by Image Inpainting (FM2I). FM2I has proven effective, but selecting the most accurate forecasts remain a challenge. To overcome this issue, we proposed a selection algorithm. Inspired by door hinges, Hinge-FM2I drops a data point either before or after the gap (left/right-hinge), then use FM2I for imputation, and then select the imputed gap based on the lowest error of the dropped data point. Hinge-FM2I was evaluated on a comprehensive sample composed of 1356 time series, extracted from the M3 competition benchmark dataset, with missing value rates ranging from 3.57\% to 28.57\%. Experimental results demonstrate that Hinge-FM2I significantly outperforms established methods such as, linear/spline interpolation, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and ARIMA. Notably, Hinge-FM2I achieves an average Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) score of 5.6\% for small gaps, and up to 10\% for larger ones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Hinge-FM2I as a promising new method for addressing missing values in univariate time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist Multimodal AI: A Review of Architectures, Challenges and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05496v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models are expected to be a critical component to future advances in artificial intelligence. This field is starting to grow rapidly with a surge of new design elements motivated by the success of foundation models in natural language processing (NLP) and vision. It is widely hoped that further extending the foundation models to multiple modalities (e.g., text, image, video, sensor, time series, graph, etc.) will ultimately lead to generalist multimodal models, i.e. one model across different data modalities and tasks. However, there is little research that systematically analyzes recent multimodal models (particularly the ones that work beyond text and vision) with respect to the underling architecture proposed. Therefore, this work provides a fresh perspective on generalist multimodal models (GMMs) via a novel architecture and training configuration specific taxonomy. This includes factors such as Unifiability, Modularity, and Adaptability that are pertinent and essential to the wide adoption and application of GMMs. The review further highlights key challenges and prospects for the field and guide the researchers into the new advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal Downsampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10634v3)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a set of synchronous time series, each associated with a sensor-point in space and characterized by inter-series relationships, the problem of spatiotemporal forecasting consists of predicting future observations for each point. Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions, particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[A case study of spatiotemporal forecasting techniques for weather forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14782v2)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of real-world processes are spatiotemporal, and the data generated by them exhibits both spatial and temporal evolution. Weather is one of the most essential processes in this domain, and weather forecasting has become a crucial part of our daily routine. Weather data analysis is considered the most complex and challenging task. Although numerical weather prediction models are currently state-of-the-art, they are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Numerous studies have proposed time series-based models as a viable alternative to numerical forecasts. Recent research in the area of time series analysis indicates significant advancements, particularly regarding the use of state-space-based models (white box) and, more recently, the integration of machine learning and deep neural network-based models (black box). The most famous examples of such models are RNNs and transformers. These models have demonstrated remarkable results in the field of time-series analysis and have demonstrated effectiveness in modelling temporal correlations. It is crucial to capture both temporal and spatial correlations for a spatiotemporal process, as the values at nearby locations and time affect the values of a spatiotemporal process at a specific point. This self-contained paper explores various regional data-driven weather forecasting methods, i.e., forecasting over multiple latitude-longitude points (matrix-shaped spatial grid) to capture spatiotemporal correlations. The results showed that spatiotemporal prediction models reduced computational costs while improving accuracy. In particular, the proposed tensor train dynamic mode decomposition-based forecasting model has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art models without the need for training. We provide convincing numerical experiments to show that the proposed approach is practical.</p></details> |  |
| **[MatrixGate: A High-performance Data Ingestion Tool for Time-series Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05462v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen massive time-series data generated in many areas. This different scenario brings new challenges, particularly in terms of data ingestion, where existing technologies struggle to handle such massive time-series data, leading to low loading speed and poor timeliness. To address these challenges, this paper presents MatrixGate, a new and efficient data ingestion approach for massive time-series data. MatrixGate implements both single-instance and multi-instance parallel procedures, which is based on its unique ingestion strategies. First, MatrixGate uses policies to tune the slots that are synchronized with segments to ingest data, which eliminates the cost of starting transactions and enhance the efficiency. Second, multi-coroutines are responsible for transfer data, which can increase the degree of parallelism significantly. Third, lock-free queues are used to enable direct data transfer without the need for disk storage or lodging in the master instance. Experiment results on multiple datasets show that MatrixGate outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3 to 100 times in loading speed, and cuts down about 80% query latency. Furthermore, MatrixGate scales out efficiently under distributed architecture, achieving scalability of 86%.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use the Transformer decoder as a conditional quantile estimator to predict the quantiles of prediction residuals, which are used to estimate the prediction interval. We hypothesize that the Transformer decoder benefits the estimation of the prediction interval by learning temporal dependencies across past prediction residuals. Our comprehensive experiments using simulated and real data empirically demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art conformal prediction methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[C-Mamba: Channel Correlation Enhanced State Space Models for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05316v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made in multivariate time series forecasting using Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models. However, these approaches face notable limitations: linear forecasters struggle with representation capacities, attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, and convolutional models have a restricted receptive field. These constraints impede their effectiveness in modeling complex time series, particularly those with numerous variables. Additionally, many models adopt the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy, treating multivariate time series as uncorrelated univariate series while ignoring their correlations. For models considering inter-channel relationships, whether through the self-attention mechanism, linear combination, or convolution, they all incur high computational costs and focus solely on weighted summation relationships, neglecting potential proportional relationships between channels. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the newly introduced state space model and propose \textbf{C-Mamba}, a novel approach that captures cross-channel dependencies while maintaining linear complexity without losing the global receptive field. Our model consists of two key components: (i) channel mixup, where two channels are mixed to enhance the training sets; (ii) channel attention enhanced patch-wise Mamba encoder that leverages the ability of the state space models to capture cross-time dependencies and models correlations between channels by mining their weight relationships. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven real-world time series datasets. Moreover, the proposed mixup and attention strategy exhibits strong generalizability across other frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[POND: Multi-Source Time Series Domain Adaptation with Information-Aware Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12276v3)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series domain adaptation stands as a pivotal and intricate challenge with diverse applications, including but not limited to human activity recognition, sleep stage classification, and machine fault diagnosis. Despite the numerous domain adaptation techniques proposed to tackle this complex problem, they primarily focus on domain adaptation from a single source domain. Yet, it is more crucial to investigate domain adaptation from multiple domains due to the potential for greater improvements. To address this, three important challenges need to be overcome: 1). The lack of exploration to utilize domain-specific information for domain adaptation, 2). The difficulty to learn domain-specific information that changes over time, and 3). The difficulty to evaluate learned domain-specific information. In order to tackle these challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we introduce PrOmpt-based domaiN Discrimination (POND), the first framework to utilize prompts for time series domain adaptation. Specifically, to address Challenge 1, we extend the idea of prompt tuning to time series analysis and learn prompts to capture common and domain-specific information from all source domains. To handle Challenge 2, we introduce a conditional module for each source domain to generate prompts from time series input data. For Challenge 3, we propose two criteria to select good prompts, which are used to choose the most suitable source domain for domain adaptation. The efficacy and robustness of our proposed POND model are extensively validated through experiments across 50 scenarios encompassing four datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed POND model outperforms all state-of-the-art comparison methods by up to $66\%$ on the F1-score.</p></details> | accepted by KDD 2024 |

While traditionally scientific models are derived through cycles of human insight and experimentation, recently deep learning (DL) techniques have been advanced to reconstruct dynamical systems (DS) directly from time series data. State-of-the-art dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) methods show promise in capturing invariant and long-term properties of observed DS, but their ability to generalize to unobserved domains remains an open challenge. Yet, this is a crucial property we would expect from any viable scientific theory. In this work, we provide a formal framework that addresses generalization in DSR. We explain why and how out-of-domain (OOD) generalization (OODG) in DSR profoundly differs from OODG considered elsewhere in machine learning. We introduce mathematical notions based on topological concepts and ergodic theory to formalize the idea of learnability of a DSR model. We formally prove that black-box DL techniques, without adequate structural priors, generally will not be able to learn a generalizing DSR model. We also show this empirically, considering major classes of DSR algorithms proposed so far, and illustrate where and why they fail to generalize across the whole phase space. Our study provides the first comprehensive mathematical treatment of OODG in DSR, and gives a deeper conceptual understanding of where the fundamental problems in OODG lie and how they could possibly be addressed in practice.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets may not encompass the full range of statistical properties required for robust and comprehensive analysis. And privacy concerns can further limit their accessibility in domains such as finance and healthcare. This paper presents an approach that utilizes large language models and data source interfaces to explore and collect time series datasets. While obtained from external sources, the collected data share critical statistical properties with primary time series datasets, making it possible to model and adapt to various scenarios. This method enlarges the data quantity when the original data is limited or lacks essential properties. It suggests that collected datasets can effectively supplement existing datasets, especially involving changes in data distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the collected datasets through practical examples and show how time series forecasting foundation models fine-tuned on these datasets achieve comparable performance to those models without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have delved into its effects on cellular network performance, demonstrating the potential to forecast rainfall levels based on electromagnetic wave attenuation during precipitations. This paper aims to solve the problem of identifying the nature of specific weather phenomena from the received signal level (RSL) in 4G/LTE mobile terminals. Specifically, utilizing time-series data representing RSL, we propose a novel approach to encode time series as images and model the task as an image classification problem, which we finally address using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The main benefit of the abovementioned procedure is the opportunity to utilize various data augmentation techniques simultaneously. This encompasses applying traditional approaches, such as moving averages, to the time series and enhancing the generated images. We have investigated various image data augmentation methods to identify the most effective combination for this scenario. In the upcoming sections, we will introduce the task of rainfall estimation and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset used. Subsequently, we will formally propose a new approach for converting time series into images. To conclude, the paper's final section will present and discuss the experiments conducted, providing the reader with a brief yet comprehensive overview of the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint is the result of work in progress, therefore it should still be considered a draft</p></details> |

| **[TimeSieve: Extracting Temporal Dynamics through Information Bottlenecks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05036v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has become an increasingly popular research area due to its critical applications in various real-world domains such as traffic management, weather prediction, and financial analysis. Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70\% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications.

However, existing Transformer models often fall short of capturing both intricate dependencies across variate and temporal dimensions in MTS data. Some recent models are proposed to separately capture variate and temporal dependencies through either two sequential or parallel attention mechanisms. However, these methods cannot directly and explicitly learn the intricate inter-series and intra-series dependencies. In this work, we first demonstrate that these dependencies are very important as they usually exist in real-world data. To directly model these dependencies, we propose a transformer-based model UniTST containing a unified attention mechanism on the flattened patch tokens. Additionally, we add a dispatcher module which reduces the complexity and makes the model feasible for a potentially large number of variates. Although our proposed model employs a simple architecture, it offers compelling performance as shown in our extensive experiments on several datasets for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualTime: A Dual-Adapter Multimodal Language Model for Time Series Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rapid development of language models (LMs) has attracted attention in the field of time series, including multimodal time series modeling. However, we note that current time series multimodal methods are biased, often assigning a primary role to one modality while the other assumes a secondary role. They overlook the mutual benefits and complementary of different modalities. For example, in seizure diagnosis, relying solely on textual clinical reports makes it difficult to pinpoint the area and type of the disease, while electroencephalograms (EEGs) alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis without considering the symptoms. In this study, based on the complementary information mining of time series multimodal data, we propose DualTime, a Dual-adapter multimodal language model for Time series representation implementing temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. By injecting lightweight adaption tokens, the LM pipeline shared by dual adapters encourages embedding alignment and achieves efficient fine-tuning. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both supervised and unsupervised settings, highlighting the complementary benefits of different modalities. In addition, we conduct few-shot label transfer experiments, which further verifies the transferability and expressiveness of our proposed DualTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Recurrent Network Topologies for Dynamical Systems Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04934v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.</p></details> |  |

In this task, the limited data availability presents a challenge as most of the available data is acquired during standard operation where extreme scenarios and transitory regimes such as major temperature increases or decreases are de-facto excluded. Acquisition of such data requires significant energy consumption and a dedicated facility, hindering the quantity and diversity of available data. Cost related constraints however do not allow for continuous year-around acquisition. To address this, we investigate the efficacy of data augmentation techniques leveraging SoTA AI-based methods for synthetic data generation. Inspired by practical and experimental motivations, we explore fusion strategies of real and synthetic data to improve forecasting models. This approach alleviates the need for continuously acquiring extensive time series data, especially in contexts involving repetitive heating and cooling cycles in buildings. In our evaluation 1) we assess the performance of synthetic data generators independently, particularly focusing on SoTA AI-based methods; 2) we measure the utility of incorporating synthetically augmented data in a subsequent forecasting tasks where we employ a simple model in two distinct scenarios: 1) we first examine an augmentation technique that combines real and synthetically generated data to expand the training dataset, 2) we delve into utilizing synthetic data to tackle dataset imbalances. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic data augmentation in enhancing forecasting accuracy while mitigating training variance. Through empirical experiments, we show significant improvements achievable by integrating synthetic data, thereby paving the way for more robust forecasting models in low-data regime.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, the controllers often only need the information-rich components of the original data. To address this, we propose a Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA) and a semantic actor trained through self-supervised learning. This approach harnesses TS-JEPA's semantic representation power and predictive capabilities by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in the source data. We leverage this to optimize uplink channel utilization, while the semantic actor calculates control commands directly from the encoded representations, rather than from the original data. We test our model through multiple parallel instances of the well-known inverted cart-pole scenario, where the approach is validated through the maximization of stability under constrained uplink channel capacity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Multimodal Data for Joint Generative Modeling of Complex Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07892v3)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many, if not most, systems of interest in science are naturally described as nonlinear dynamical systems. Empirically, we commonly access these systems through time series measurements. Often such time series may consist of discrete random variables rather than continuous measurements, or may be composed of measurements from multiple data modalities observed simultaneously. For instance, in neuroscience we may have behavioral labels in addition to spike counts and continuous physiological recordings. While by now there is a burgeoning literature on deep learning for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), multimodal data integration has hardly been considered in this context. Here we provide such an efficient and flexible algorithmic framework that rests on a multimodal variational autoencoder for generating a sparse teacher signal that guides training of a reconstruction model, exploiting recent advances in DSR training techniques. It enables to combine various sources of information for optimal reconstruction, even allows for reconstruction from symbolic data (class labels) alone, and connects different types of observations within a common latent dynamics space. In contrast to previous multimodal data integration techniques for scientific applications, our framework is fully \textit{generative}, producing, after training, trajectories with the same geometrical and temporal structure as those of the ground truth system.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

One of the most popular methods assumes that the temporal distribution shift occurs uniformly to disentangle the stationary and nonstationary dependencies. But this assumption is difficult to meet, as we do not know when the distribution shifts occur. To solve this problem, we propose to learn IDentifiable latEnt stAtes (IDEA) to detect when the distribution shifts occur. Beyond that, we further disentangle the stationary and nonstationary latent states via sufficient observation assumption to learn how the latent states change. Specifically, we formalize the causal process with environment-irrelated stationary and environment-related nonstationary variables. Under mild conditions, we show that latent environments and stationary/nonstationary variables are identifiable. Based on these theories, we devise the IDEA model, which incorporates an autoregressive hidden Markov model to estimate latent environments and modular prior networks to identify latent states. The IDEA model outperforms several latest nonstationary forecasting methods on various benchmark datasets, highlighting its advantages in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Identification of Temporally Causal Representation with Instantaneous Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15325v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally causal representation learning aims to identify the latent causal process from time series observations, but most methods require the assumption that the latent causal processes do not have instantaneous relations. Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\textbf{O}us \textbf{L}atent dynamics (\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Regularizing Hidden States Enables Learning Generalizable Reward Model for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10216v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models trained on human preference data have been proven to be effective for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent within the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework. However, the generalization capabilities of current reward models to unseen prompts and responses are limited. This limitation can lead to an unexpected phenomenon known as reward over-optimization, where excessive optimization of rewards results in a decline in actual performance. While previous research has advocated for constraining policy optimization, our study proposes a novel approach to enhance the reward model's generalization ability against distribution shifts by regularizing the hidden states. Specifically, we retain the base model's language model head and incorporate a suite of text-generation losses to preserve the hidden states' text generation capabilities, while concurrently learning a reward head behind the same hidden states. Our experimental results demonstrate that the introduced regularization technique markedly improves the accuracy of learned reward models across a variety of out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks and effectively alleviate the over-optimization issue in RLHF, offering a more reliable and robust preference learning paradigm.</p></details> | 21 pages |

A common solution to this memory challenge is offloading compute and data from the GPU to the CPU. However, this approach is hampered by the limited bandwidth of commodity hardware, which constrains communication between the CPU and GPU. In this paper, we present an offloading framework, LSP_Offload, that enables near-native speed LLM fine-tuning on commodity hardware through learned subspace projectors. Our data-driven approach involves learning an efficient sparse compressor that minimizes communication with minimal precision loss. Additionally, we introduce a novel layer-wise communication schedule to maximize parallelism between communication and computation. As a result, our framework can fine-tune a 1.3 billion parameter model on a 4GB laptop GPU and a 7 billion parameter model on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB memory, achieving only a 31% slowdown compared to fine-tuning with unlimited memory. Compared to state-of-the-art offloading frameworks, our approach increases fine-tuning throughput by up to 3.33 times and reduces end-to-end fine-tuning time by 33.1%~62.5% when converging to the same accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLoPe: Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-Rank Adapter Pretraining of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16325v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SLoPe, a Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-rank Adapter Pretraining method for LLMs that improves the accuracy of sparse LLMs while accelerating their pretraining and inference and reducing their memory footprint. Sparse pretraining of LLMs reduces the accuracy of the model, to overcome this, prior work uses dense models during fine-tuning. SLoPe improves the accuracy of sparsely pretrained models by adding low-rank adapters in the final 1% iterations of pretraining without adding significant overheads to the model pretraining and inference. In addition, SLoPe uses a double-pruned backward pass formulation that prunes the transposed weight matrix using N:M sparsity structures to enable an accelerated sparse backward pass. SLoPe accelerates the training and inference of models with billions of parameters up to $1.14\times$ and $1.34\times$ respectively (OPT-33B and OPT-66B) while reducing their memory usage by up to $0.77\times$ and $0.51\times$ for training and inference respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[BABILong: Testing the Limits of LLMs with Long Context Reasoning-in-a-Haystack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10149v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the input context sizes of large language models (LLMs) have increased dramatically. However, existing evaluation methods have not kept pace, failing to comprehensively assess the efficiency of models in handling long contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce the BABILong benchmark, designed to test language models' ability to reason across facts distributed in extremely long documents. BABILong includes a diverse set of 20 reasoning tasks, including fact chaining, simple induction, deduction, counting, and handling lists/sets. These tasks are challenging on their own, and even more demanding when the required facts are scattered across long natural text. Our evaluations show that popular LLMs effectively utilize only 10-20\% of the context and their performance declines sharply with increased reasoning complexity. Among alternatives to in-context reasoning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods achieve a modest 60\% accuracy on single-fact question answering, independent of context length. Among context extension methods, the highest performance is demonstrated by recurrent memory transformers, enabling the processing of lengths up to 11 million tokens. The BABILong benchmark is extendable to any length to support the evaluation of new upcoming models with increased capabilities, and we provide splits up to 1 million token lengths.</p></details> |  |

High-quality software requirements not only enhance the manual software development process but also position organizations to fully harness the potential of the emerging LLMs technology. This paper introduces a tailored LLM for automating the generation of code snippets from well-structured requirements documents. This LLM is augmented with knowledge, heuristics, and instructions that are pertinent to the software development process, requirements analysis, object-oriented design, and test-driven development, effectively emulating the expertise of a seasoned software engineer. We introduce a "Progressive Prompting" method that allows software engineers to engage with this LLM in a stepwise manner. Through this approach, the LLM incrementally tackles software development tasks by interpreting the provided requirements to extract functional requirements, using these to create object-oriented models, and subsequently generating unit tests and code based on the object-oriented designs. We demonstrate the LLM's proficiency in comprehending intricate user requirements and producing robust design and code solutions through a case study focused on the development of a web project. This study underscores the potential of integrating LLMs into the software development workflow to significantly enhance both efficiency and quality. The tailored LLM is available at https://chat.openai.com/g/g-bahoiKzkB-software-engineer-gpt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know the Unknown: An Uncertainty-Sensitive Method for LLM Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10099v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but still face challenges such as hallucinations. One potential reason for hallucinations is the lack of relevant knowledge or context. Thus, a promising solution to mitigate this issue involves instructing LLMs to respond with "I do not know" when a question falls outside their knowledge domain or the provided context. However, in this work, we observed that LLMs struggle to admit their lack of knowledge, primarily due to existing instruction datasets designed to encourage specific answers. To improve large language models' capability to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, we propose a novel approach called uncertainty-sensitive tuning. This method involves two-stage training designed for uncertainty recognition and prompt-sensitive activation. In the first stage, we guide the LLM to reject unknown questions. In the second stage, we recover the decreased performance in QA tasks by incorporating designed causal instructions. By leveraging this method, we aim to enhance the model's ability to identify areas of uncertainty. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed uncertainty-sensitive tuning method significantly improves the performance of the Llama2-chat-7B model. Specifically, it achieves a substantial 34.7% improvement in handling questions involving knowledge gaps compared to the original model. Moreover, our approach outperforms GPT-4, exhibiting a 9.4% increase in overall performance. We open-source the model and code on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

To date, researchers have proposed two technical categories to enhance LLM-based repository-level code completion, i.e., retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and static analysis integration. This work performs the first study on the static analysis integration in LLM-based repository-level code completion by investigating both the effectiveness and efficiency of static analysis integration strategies across different phases of code completion. We first implement a framework STALL+, which supports an extendable and customizable integration of multiple static analysis strategies into the complete pipeline of LLM-based repository-level code completion; and based on STALL+, we perform extensive experiments by including different code LLMs on the latest repository-level code completion benchmark CrossCodeEval. Our findings show that integrating file-level dependencies in prompting phase performs the best while the integration in post-processing phase performs the worse. Additionally, we observe different improvements from static analysis between dynamic languages and static languages, i.e., the best combination is prompting-phase with decoding-phase integration for Java while the best combination is prompting-phase with post-processing-phase integration for Python given the limitations of statically analyzing dynamic languages. Additionally, we find the complementarity between RAG and static analysis integration as well as their cost-effectiveness after combination.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Survey on RAG Meeting LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06211v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most advanced techniques in AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can offer reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, providing huge convenience for numerous tasks. Particularly in the era of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in providing additional knowledge enables RAG to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RA-LLMs) have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in RA-LLMs, covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we systematically review mainstream relevant work by their architectures, training strategies, and application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.

While LLMs are increasingly used for scoring various inputs, creating effective prompts for open-ended text evaluation remains challenging due to model sensitivity and subjectivity in evaluation of text generation. Our study experimented with different prompt structures, altering the sequence of output instructions and including explanatory reasons. We found that the order of presenting reasons and scores significantly influences LLMs' scoring, with a different level of rule understanding in the prompt. An additional optimization may enhance scoring alignment if sufficient data is available. This insight is crucial for improving the accuracy and consistency of LLM-based evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in JSAI 2024.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid SLT approach, Spotter+GPT, that utilizes a sign spotter and a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to improve SLT performance. Spotter+GPT breaks down the SLT task into two stages. The videos are first processed by the Spotter, which is trained on a linguistic sign language dataset, to identify individual signs. These spotted signs are then passed to an LLM, which transforms them into coherent and contextually appropriate spoken language sentences. The source code of the Spotter is available at https://gitlab.surrey.ac.uk/cogvispublic/sign-spotter.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLEnD: A Benchmark for LLMs on Everyday Knowledge in Diverse Cultures and Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09948v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often lack culture-specific knowledge of daily life, especially across diverse regions and non-English languages. Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' cultural sensitivities are limited to a single language or collected from online sources such as Wikipedia, which do not reflect the mundane everyday lifestyles of diverse regions. That is, information about the food people eat for their birthday celebrations, spices they typically use, musical instruments youngsters play, or the sports they practice in school is common cultural knowledge but uncommon in easily collected online sources, especially for underrepresented cultures. To address this issue, we introduce BLEnD, a hand-crafted benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' everyday knowledge across diverse cultures and languages. BLEnD comprises 52.6k question-answer pairs from 16 countries/regions, in 13 different languages, including low-resource ones such as Amharic, Assamese, Azerbaijani, Hausa, and Sundanese. We construct the benchmark to include two formats of questions: short-answer and multiple-choice. We show that LLMs perform better for cultures that are highly represented online, with a maximum 57.34% difference in GPT-4, the best-performing model, in the short-answer format. For cultures represented by mid-to-high-resource languages, LLMs perform better in their local languages, but for cultures represented by low-resource languages, LLMs perform better in English than the local languages. We make our dataset publicly available at: https://github.com/nlee0212/BLEnD.</p></details> |  |

We compile a dataset called \textbf{\textit{LimGen}}, encompassing 4068 research papers and their associated limitations from the ACL anthology. We investigate several approaches to harness large language models (LLMs) for producing suggestive limitations, by thoroughly examining the related challenges, practical insights, and potential opportunities.

This work presents the first attempt to investigate the degree of gender bias present in existing LLMs (ChatGPT, LLaMA 2, and Bard) using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. From our quantitative evaluation, we found that ChatGPT performs the best across various performance metrics and LLaMA 2 outperforms other LLMs in terms of group fairness metrics. As qualitative fairness evaluation remains an open research question we propose several strategies (e.g., word count, thematic analysis) to investigate whether and how a qualitative evaluation can provide valuable insights for bias analysis beyond what is possible with quantitative evaluation. We found that ChatGPT consistently provides a more comprehensive, well-reasoned explanation for its prediction compared to LLaMA 2. We have also identified several themes adopted by LLMs to qualitatively evaluate gender fairness. We hope our results can be used as a stepping stone towards future attempts at improving qualitative evaluation of fairness for LLMs especially for high-stakes tasks such as depression detection.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09834v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, have shown effectiveness in generating code completions. However, in LLM-based code completion, LLMs may struggle to use correct and up-to-date Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) due to the rapid and continuous evolution of libraries. While existing studies have highlighted issues with predicting incorrect APIs, the specific problem of deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we conducted the first evaluation study on deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion. This study involved seven advanced LLMs, 145 API mappings from eight popular Python libraries, and 28,125 completion prompts. The study results reveal the \textit{status quo} and \textit{root causes} of deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion from the perspectives of \textit{model}, \textit{prompt}, and \textit{library}. Based on these findings, we propose two lightweight fixing approaches, \textsc{ReplaceAPI} and \textsc{InsertPrompt}, which can serve as baseline approaches for future research on mitigating deprecated API usage in LLM-based completion. Additionally, we provide implications for future research on integrating library evolution with LLM-driven software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM-driven User-Intent Formalization for Verification-Aware Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09757v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verification-aware programming languages such as Dafny and F* provide means to formally specify and prove properties of programs. Although the problem of checking an implementation against a specification can be defined mechanically, there is no algorithmic way of ensuring the correctness of the user-intent formalization for programs -- that a specification adheres to the user's intent behind the program. The intent or requirement is expressed informally in natural language and the specification is a formal artefact. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has made strides bridging the gap between informal intent and formal program implementations recently, driven in large parts due to benchmarks and automated metrics for evaluation. Recent work has proposed evaluating {\it user-intent formalization} problem for mainstream programming languages~\cite{endres-fse24}. However, such an approach does not readily extend to verification-aware languages that support rich specifications (containing quantifiers and ghost variables) that cannot be evaluated through dynamic execution. Previous work also required generating program mutants using LLMs to create the benchmark. We advocate an alternate approach of {\it symbolically testing specifications} to provide an intuitive metric for evaluating the quality of specifications for verification-aware languages. We demonstrate that our automated metric agrees closely with mostly GPT-4 generated and human-labeled dataset of roughly 150 Dafny specifications for the popular MBPP code-generation benchmark, yet demonstrates cases where the human labeling is not perfect. We believe our work provides a stepping stone to enable the establishment of a benchmark and research agenda for the problem of user-intent formalization for programs.</p></details> |  |

However, few methods consider the underlying rationales behind interactions, such as user preferences and item attributes, limiting the reasoning capability of LLMs for recommendations. This paper proposes a rationale distillation recommender (RDRec), a compact model designed to learn rationales generated by a larger language model (LM). By leveraging rationales from reviews related to users and items, RDRec remarkably specifies their profiles for recommendations. Experiments show that RDRec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both top-N and sequential recommendations.

Chatbots have shown promise in promoting positive mental health practices, yet their rigid interaction flows and less human-like conversational experiences present significant limitations. In this work, we explore whether the anthropomorphic design (both LLM's persona design and conversational experience design) can enhance users' perception of the system and their willingness to adopt mental well-being activity recommendations. To this end, we introduce Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent designed to offer personalized well-being support through multi-turn conversation and recommend practical actions grounded in positive psychology and social psychology. An empirical user study comparing the user experience with Sunnie and with a traditional survey-based activity recommendation system suggests that the anthropomorphic characteristics of Sunnie significantly enhance users' perception of the system and the overall usability; nevertheless, users' willingness to adopt activity recommendations did not change significantly.</p></details> | In Submission |

Using LLMs as a Teachable Agent for Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05292v4)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) now excel at generative skills and can create content at impeccable speeds. However, they are imperfect and still make various mistakes. In a Computer Science education context, as these models are widely recognized as "AI pair programmers," it becomes increasingly important to train students on evaluating and debugging the LLM-generated code. In this work, we introduce HypoCompass, a novel system to facilitate deliberate practice on debugging, where human novices play the role of Teaching Assistants and help LLM-powered teachable agents debug code. We enable effective task delegation between students and LLMs in this learning-by-teaching environment: students focus on hypothesizing the cause of code errors, while adjacent skills like code completion are offloaded to LLM-agents. Our evaluations demonstrate that HypoCompass generates high-quality training materials (e.g., bugs and fixes), outperforming human counterparts fourfold in efficiency, and significantly improves student performance on debugging by 12% in the pre-to-post test.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This is the first "decoder-only" ASR architecture designed to handle continuous audio without explicit end-pointing. Speech ReaLLM is a special case of the more general ReaLLM ("real-time LLM") approach, also introduced here for the first time. The idea is inspired by RNN-T: Instead of generating a response only at the end of a user prompt, generate after every input token received in real time (it is often empty). On Librispeech "test", an 80M Speech ReaLLM achieves WERs of 3.0% and 7.4% in real time (without an external LM or auxiliary loss). This is only slightly above a 3x larger Attention-Encoder-Decoder baseline. We also show that this way, an LLM architecture can learn to represent and reproduce the flow of time; and that a pre-trained 7B LLM can be fine-tuned to do reasonably well on this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Metrics: Evaluating LLMs' Effectiveness in Culturally Nuanced, Low-Resource Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00343v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in multilingual and code-mixed communication settings. This research evaluates the performance of seven leading LLMs in sentiment analysis on a dataset derived from multilingual and code-mixed WhatsApp chats, including Swahili, English and Sheng. Our evaluation includes both quantitative analysis using metrics like F1 score and qualitative assessment of LLMs' explanations for their predictions. We find that, while Mistral-7b and Mixtral-8x7b achieved high F1 scores, they and other LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-2-70b, and Gemma-7b struggled with understanding linguistic and contextual nuances, as well as lack of transparency in their decision-making process as observed from their explanations. In contrast, GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo excelled in grasping diverse linguistic inputs and managing various contextual information, demonstrating high consistency with human alignment and transparency in their decision-making process. The LLMs however, encountered difficulties in incorporating cultural nuance especially in non-English settings with GPT-4s doing so inconsistently. The findings emphasize the necessity of continuous improvement of LLMs to effectively tackle the challenges of culturally nuanced, low-resource real-world settings and the need for developing evaluation benchmarks for capturing these issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bag of Tricks: Benchmarking of Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09324v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks and can be manipulated to produce harmful outputs. Recently, a growing body of research has categorized jailbreak attacks into token-level and prompt-level attacks. However, previous work primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. To address these issues, we evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline benchmark for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework. Specifically, we evaluate the eight key factors of implementing jailbreak attacks on LLMs from both target-level and attack-level perspectives. We further conduct seven representative jailbreak attacks on six defense methods across two widely used datasets, encompassing approximately 320 experiments with about 50,000 GPU hours on A800-80G. Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Bag_of_Tricks_for_LLM_Jailbreaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Guidelines for Deploying LLMs onto Resource-constrained Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03777v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling laws have become the de facto guidelines for designing large language models (LLMs), but they were studied under the assumption of unlimited computing resources for both training and inference. As LLMs are increasingly used as personalized intelligent assistants, their customization (i.e., learning through fine-tuning) and deployment onto resource-constrained edge devices will become more and more prevalent. An urging but open question is how a resource-constrained computing environment would affect the design choices for a personalized LLM. We study this problem empirically in this work. In particular, we consider the tradeoffs among a number of key design factors and their intertwined impacts on learning efficiency and accuracy. The factors include the learning methods for LLM customization, the amount of personalized data used for learning customization, the types and sizes of LLMs, the compression methods of LLMs, the amount of time afforded to learn, and the difficulty levels of the target use cases. Through extensive experimentation and benchmarking, we draw a number of surprisingly insightful guidelines for deploying LLMs onto resource-constrained devices. For example, an optimal choice between parameter learning and RAG may vary depending on the difficulty of the downstream task, the longer fine-tuning time does not necessarily help the model, and a compressed LLM may be a better choice than an uncompressed LLM to learn from limited personalized data.</p></details> | Benckmarking paper |
| **[Sharing Matters: Analysing Neurons Across Languages and Tasks in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09265v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have greatly increased the ceiling of performance on non-English tasks. However the mechanisms behind multilingualism in these LLMs are poorly understood. Of particular interest is the degree to which internal representations are shared between languages. Recent work on neuron analysis of LLMs has focused on the monolingual case, and the limited work on the multilingual case has not considered the interaction between tasks and linguistic representations. In our work, we investigate how neuron activation is shared across languages by categorizing neurons into four distinct groups according to their responses across different languages for a particular input: all-shared, partial-shared, specific, and non-activated. This categorization is combined with a study of neuron attribution, i.e. the importance of a neuron w.r.t an output. Our analysis reveals the following insights: (i) the linguistic sharing patterns are strongly affected by the type of task, but neuron behaviour changes across different inputs even for the same task; (ii) all-shared neurons play a key role in generating correct responses; (iii) boosting multilingual alignment by increasing all-shared neurons can enhance accuracy on multilingual tasks.

Due to several limiting factors surrounding LLMs (training cost, API access, data availability, etc.), it may not always be feasible to impose direct safety constraints on a deployed model. Therefore, an efficient and reliable alternative is required. To this end, we present our ongoing efforts to create and deploy a library of detectors: compact and easy-to-build classification models that provide labels for various harms. In addition to the detectors themselves, we discuss a wide range of uses for these detector models - from acting as guardrails to enabling effective AI governance. We also deep dive into inherent challenges in their development and discuss future work aimed at making the detectors more reliable and broadening their scope.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Challenges of Evaluating LLM Applications: An Analysis of Automated, Human, and LLM-Based Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03339v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chatbots have been an interesting application of natural language generation since its inception. With novel transformer based Generative AI methods, building chatbots have become trivial. Chatbots which are targeted at specific domains for example medicine and psychology are implemented rapidly. This however, should not distract from the need to evaluate the chatbot responses. Especially because the natural language generation community does not entirely agree upon how to effectively evaluate such applications. With this work we discuss the issue further with the increasingly popular LLM based evaluations and how they correlate with human evaluations. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive factored evaluation mechanism that can be utilized in conjunction with both human and LLM-based evaluations. We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations which consumed educational reports, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation. Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The First Workshop on Large Language Models for Evaluation in Information Retrieval</p></details> |
| **[GuardAgent: Safeguard LLM Agents by a Guard Agent via Knowledge-Enabled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09187v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the deployment of LLM-powered agents across numerous applications, raising new concerns regarding their safety and trustworthiness. Existing methods for enhancing the safety of LLMs are not directly transferable to LLM-powered agents due to their diverse objectives and output modalities. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first LLM agent as a guardrail to other LLM agents. Specifically, GuardAgent oversees a target LLM agent by checking whether its inputs/outputs satisfy a set of given guard requests defined by the users. GuardAgent comprises two steps: 1) creating a task plan by analyzing the provided guard requests, and 2) generating guardrail code based on the task plan and executing the code by calling APIs or using external engines. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the core reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module. Such knowledge-enabled reasoning allows GuardAgent to understand various textual guard requests and accurately "translate" them into executable code that provides reliable guardrails. Furthermore, GuardAgent is equipped with an extendable toolbox containing functions and APIs and requires no additional LLM training, which underscores its generalization capabilities and low operational overhead. Additionally, we propose two novel benchmarks: an EICU-AC benchmark for assessing privacy-related access control for healthcare agents and a Mind2Web-SC benchmark for safety evaluation for web agents. We show the effectiveness of GuardAgent on these two benchmarks with 98.7% and 90.0% accuracy in moderating invalid inputs and outputs for the two types of agents, respectively. We also show that GuardAgent is able to define novel functions in adaption to emergent LLM agents and guard requests, which underscores its strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test of Time: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09170v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet they remain susceptible to errors, particularly in temporal reasoning tasks involving complex temporal logic. Existing research has explored LLM performance on temporal reasoning using diverse datasets and benchmarks. However, these studies often rely on real-world data that LLMs may have encountered during pre-training or employ anonymization techniques that can inadvertently introduce factual inconsistencies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing novel synthetic datasets specifically designed to assess LLM temporal reasoning abilities in various scenarios. The diversity of question types across these datasets enables systematic investigation into the impact of the problem structure, size, question type, fact order, and other factors on LLM performance. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in temporal reasoning tasks. To foster further research in this area, we are open-sourcing the datasets and evaluation framework used in our experiments: https://huggingface.co/datasets/baharef/ToT.</p></details> |  |
| **[DefAn: Definitive Answer Dataset for LLMs Hallucination Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09155v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, revolutionizing the integration of AI in daily life applications. However, they are prone to hallucinations, generating claims that contradict established facts, deviating from prompts, and producing inconsistent responses when the same prompt is presented multiple times. Addressing these issues is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive and easily assessable benchmark datasets. Most existing datasets are small and rely on multiple-choice questions, which are inadequate for evaluating the generative prowess of LLMs. To measure hallucination in LLMs, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising over 75,000 prompts across eight domains. These prompts are designed to elicit definitive, concise, and informative answers. The dataset is divided into two segments: one publicly available for testing and assessing LLM performance and a hidden segment for benchmarking various LLMs. In our experiments, we tested six LLMs-GPT-3.5, LLama 2, LLama 3, Gemini, Mixtral, and Zephyr-revealing that overall factual hallucination ranges from 59% to 82% on the public dataset and 57% to 76% in the hidden benchmark. Prompt misalignment hallucination ranges from 6% to 95% in the public dataset and 17% to 94% in the hidden counterpart. Average consistency ranges from 21% to 61% and 22% to 63%, respectively. Domain-wise analysis shows that LLM performance significantly deteriorates when asked for specific numeric information while performing moderately with person, location, and date queries. Our dataset demonstrates its efficacy and serves as a comprehensive benchmark for LLM performance evaluation. Our dataset and LLMs responses are available at \href{https://github.com/ashikiut/DefAn}{https://github.com/ashikiut/DefAn}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain of Preference Optimization: Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09136v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding has enabled large language models (LLMs) to generate explicit logical reasoning paths for complex problem-solving. However, research indicates that these paths are not always deliberate and optimal. The tree-of-thought (ToT) method employs tree-searching to extensively explore the reasoning space and find better reasoning paths that CoT decoding might overlook. This deliberation, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased inference complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs leveraging the search tree constructed by ToT allows CoT to achieve similar or better performance, thereby avoiding the substantial inference burden. This is achieved through Chain of Preference Optimization (CPO), where LLMs are fine-tuned to align each step of the CoT reasoning paths with those of ToT using the inherent preference information in the tree-search process. Extensive experimental results show that CPO significantly improves LLM performance in solving a variety of complex problems, including question answering, fact verification, and arithmetic reasoning, demonstrating its effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/CPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Programming by Example solved by LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08316v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming-by-Examples (PBE) aims to generate an algorithm from input-output examples. Such systems are practically and theoretically important: from an end-user perspective, they are deployed to millions of people, and from an AI perspective, PBE corresponds to a very general form of few-shot inductive inference. Given the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-generation tasks, we investigate here the extent to which LLMs can be said to have `solved' PBE. We experiment on classic domains such as lists and strings, and an uncommon graphics programming domain not well represented in typical pretraining data. We find that pretrained models are not effective at PBE, but that they can be fine-tuned for much higher performance, provided the test problems are in-distribution. We analyze empirically what causes these models to succeed and fail, and take steps toward understanding how to achieve better out-of-distribution generalization. Collectively these results suggest that LLMs make strong progress toward solving the typical suite of PBE tasks, potentially increasing the flexibility and applicability of PBE systems, while also identifying ways in which LLMs still fall short.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiLoRA: Harnessing Minor Singular Components for Parameter-Efficient LLM Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09044v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient finetuning of large language models (LLMs) aims to adapt the LLMs with reduced computation and memory cost. Previous LoRA-based approaches initialize the low-rank matrices with gaussian distribution and zero values, while keeping the original weight matrices frozen. However, the trainable model parameters optimized in an unguided subspace might have interference with the well-learned subspace of the pretrained weight matrix. In this paper, we propose MiLoRA, a simple yet effective LLM finetuning approach that only updates the minor singular components of the weight matrix while keeping the principle singular components frozen. It is observed that the minor matrix corresponds to the noisy or long-tail information, while the principle matrix contains important knowledge. The MiLoRA initializes the low-rank matrices within a subspace that is orthogonal to the principle matrix, thus the pretrained knowledge is expected to be well preserved. During finetuning, MiLoRA makes the most use of the less-optimized subspace for learning the finetuning dataset. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and instruction following benchmarks present the superior performance of our method.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) offers the chance to create advanced GUI agents. To ensure their effectiveness, there's a pressing need for qualified benchmarks that provide trustworthy and reproducible evaluations -- a challenge current benchmarks often fail to address. To tackle this issue, we introduce Mobile-Env, a comprehensive toolkit tailored for creating GUI benchmarks in the Android mobile environment. Mobile-Env offers an isolated and controllable setting for reliable evaluations, and accommodates intermediate instructions and rewards to reflect real-world usage more naturally. Utilizing Mobile-Env, we collect an open-world task set across various real-world apps and a fixed world set, WikiHow, which captures a significant amount of dynamic online contents for fully controllable and reproducible evaluation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of LLM agents using these benchmarks. Our findings reveal that even advanced models (e.g., GPT-4V and LLaMA-3) struggle with tasks that are relatively simple for humans. This highlights a crucial gap in current models and underscores the importance of developing more capable foundation models and more effective GUI agent frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Statistical Modeling with Predictors from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09012v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State of the art large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a variety of benchmark tasks and are increasingly used as components in larger applications, where LLM-based predictions serve as proxies for human judgements or decision. This raises questions about the human-likeness of LLM-derived information, alignment with human intuition, and whether LLMs could possibly be considered (parts of) explanatory models of (aspects of) human cognition or language use. To shed more light on these issues, we here investigate the human-likeness of LLMs' predictions for multiple-choice decision tasks from the perspective of Bayesian statistical modeling. Using human data from a forced-choice experiment on pragmatic language use, we find that LLMs do not capture the variance in the human data at the item-level. We suggest different ways of deriving full distributional predictions from LLMs for aggregate, condition-level data, and find that some, but not all ways of obtaining condition-level predictions yield adequate fits to human data. These results suggests that assessment of LLM performance depends strongly on seemingly subtle choices in methodology, and that LLMs are at best predictors of human behavior at the aggregate, condition-level, for which they are, however, not designed to, or usually used to, make predictions in the first place.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, parallel submission to a journal</p></details> |
| **[LLM Reading Tea Leaves: Automatically Evaluating Topic Models with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09008v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topic modeling has been a widely used tool for unsupervised text analysis. However, comprehensive evaluations of a topic model remain challenging. Existing evaluation methods are either less comparable across different models (e.g., perplexity) or focus on only one specific aspect of a model (e.g., topic quality or document representation quality) at a time, which is insufficient to reflect the overall model performance. In this paper, we propose WALM (Words Agreement with Language Model), a new evaluation method for topic modeling that comprehensively considers the semantic quality of document representations and topics in a joint manner, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). With extensive experiments involving different types of topic models, WALM is shown to align with human judgment and can serve as a complementary evaluation method to the existing ones, bringing a new perspective to topic modeling. Our software package will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Yang/Topic_Model_Evaluation, which can be integrated with many widely used topic models.</p></details> |  |

The recent surge in research on LLM-based audio models provides fresh perspectives for tackling audio tasks. Given that LLM can flexibly ingest multiple inputs, we propose MaLa-ASR, an LLM-based ASR model that can integrate textual keywords extracted from presentation slides to improve recognition of conference content. MaLa-ASR yields average WERs of 9.4% and 11.7% on the L95 and S95 subsets of the SlideSpeech corpus, representing a significant relative WER drop of 27.9% and 44.7% over the baseline model reported in SlideSpeech. MaLa-ASR underscores LLM's strong performance in speech tasks and the capability to integrate auxiliary information conveniently. By adding keywords to the input prompt, the biased word error rate (B-WER) reduces relatively by 46.0% and 44.2%, establishing a new SOTA on this dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Alignment and Jailbreak Work: Explain LLM Safety through Intermediate Hidden States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05644v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to avoid responding to malicious user inputs. Unfortunately, jailbreak can circumvent safety guardrails, resulting in LLMs generating harmful content and raising concerns about LLM safety. Due to language models with intensive parameters often regarded as black boxes, the mechanisms of alignment and jailbreak are challenging to elucidate. In this paper, we employ weak classifiers to explain LLM safety through the intermediate hidden states. We first confirm that LLMs learn ethical concepts during pre-training rather than alignment and can identify malicious and normal inputs in the early layers. Alignment actually associates the early concepts with emotion guesses in the middle layers and then refines them to the specific reject tokens for safe generations. Jailbreak disturbs the transformation of early unethical classification into negative emotions. We conduct experiments on models from 7B to 70B across various model families to prove our conclusion. Overall, our paper indicates the intrinsical mechanism of LLM safety and how jailbreaks circumvent safety guardrails, offering a new perspective on LLM safety and reducing concerns.

However, recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real-world robot experiments and applications. To address these concerns, we conduct an HRI-based evaluation of discrimination and safety criteria on several highly-rated LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs currently lack robustness when encountering people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics (e.g., race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion, and their intersections), producing biased outputs consistent with directly discriminatory outcomes -- e.g. `gypsy' and `mute' people are labeled untrustworthy, but not `european' or `able-bodied' people. Furthermore, we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept dangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions -- such as incident-causing misstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation. Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so. Data and code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages (52 with references), 21 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing this challenge by efficiently analyzing vast and complex data. Existing benchmarks, however, fall short in properly evaluating LLMs' capabilities in this context, as they typically focus on single-note information or limited topics, failing to reflect the real-world inquiries required by clinicians. To bridge this gap, we introduce EHRNoteQA, a novel benchmark built on the MIMIC-IV EHR, comprising 962 different QA pairs each linked to distinct patients' discharge summaries. Every QA pair is initially generated using GPT-4 and then manually reviewed and refined by three clinicians to ensure clinical relevance. EHRNoteQA includes questions that require information across multiple discharge summaries and covers eight diverse topics, mirroring the complexity and diversity of real clinical inquiries. We offer EHRNoteQA in two formats: open-ended and multi-choice question answering, and propose a reliable evaluation method for each. We evaluate 27 LLMs using EHRNoteQA and examine various factors affecting the model performance (e.g., the length and number of discharge summaries). Furthermore, to validate EHRNoteQA as a reliable proxy for expert evaluations in clinical practice, we measure the correlation between the LLM performance on EHRNoteQA, and the LLM performance manually evaluated by clinicians. Results show that LLM performance on EHRNoteQA have higher correlation with clinician-evaluated performance (Spearman: 0.78, Kendall: 0.62) compared to other benchmarks, demonstrating its practical relevance in evaluating LLMs in clinical settings.</p></details> | Under Review |

To accomplish this, we propose to utilize cross-modal attention techniques in a pre-trained GPT-based TTS. We combine linguistic tokens from text, speaker identity tokens via a voice cloning network, and video tokens via a proposed duration controller network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on the Lip2Wav-Chemistry and LRS2 datasets. Also, the proposed method achieves improved lip sync and naturalness compared to the SOTAs for the same language but different text (i.e., non-parallel) and the different language, different text (i.e., cross-lingual) scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |

In doing so, we discuss their claims as well as challenges to scientific inference under these various paradigms.

However, efficiently serving multiple LLMs poses significant challenges for existing approaches due to varying popularity of LLMs. In the paper, we present MuxServe, a flexible spatial-temporal multiplexing system for efficient multiple LLM serving. The key insight behind is to colocate LLMs considering their popularity to multiplex memory resources, and leverage the characteristics of prefill and decoding phases to separate and flexibly colocate them to multiplex computation resources. MuxServe formally formulates the multiplexing problem, and proposes a novel placement algorithm and adaptive batch scheduling strategy to identify optimal colocations and maximize utilization. MuxServe designs a unified resource manager to enable flexible and efficient multiplexing. Evaluation results show that MuxServe can achieves up to $1.8\times$ higher throughput or processes $2.9\times$ more requests within $99\%$ SLO attainment.

In comparison, large language models (LLMs) recently exhibit impressive generalization in diverse fields. Although massive LLM based approaches are proposed for time series tasks, these methods require to load the whole LLM in both training and reference. This high computational demands limit practical applications in resource-constrained settings, like edge-computing and IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Pruning (KP), a novel paradigm for time series learning in this paper. For a specific downstream task, we argue that the world knowledge learned by LLMs is much redundant and only the related knowledge termed as "pertinent knowledge" is useful. Unlike other methods, our KP targets to prune the redundant knowledge and only distill the pertinent knowledge into the target model. This reduces model size and computational costs significantly. Additionally, different from existing LLM based approaches, our KP does not require to load the LLM in the process of training and testing, further easing computational burdens. With our proposed KP, a lightweight network can effectively learn the pertinent knowledge, achieving satisfactory performances with a low computation cost. To verify the effectiveness of our KP, two fundamental tasks on edge-computing devices are investigated in our experiments, where eight diverse environments or benchmarks with different networks are used to verify the generalization of our KP. Through experiments, our KP demonstrates effective learning of pertinent knowledge, achieving notable performance improvements in regression (19.7% on average) and classification (up to 13.7%) tasks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Recent studies have discovered that the safety alignment of LLMs can be bypassed by jailbreaking prompts. These prompts are designed to create specific conversation scenarios with a harmful question embedded. Querying an LLM with such prompts can mislead the model into responding to the harmful question. The stochastic and random nature of existing genetic methods largely limits the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) jailbreaking attacks. In this paper, we propose RL-JACK, a novel black-box jailbreaking attack powered by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We formulate the generation of jailbreaking prompts as a search problem and design a novel RL approach to solve it. Our method includes a series of customized designs to enhance the RL agent's learning efficiency in the jailbreaking context. Notably, we devise an LLM-facilitated action space that enables diverse action variations while constraining the overall search space. We propose a novel reward function that provides meaningful dense rewards for the agent toward achieving successful jailbreaking. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that RL-JACK is overall much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six SOTA LLMs, including large open-source models and commercial models. We also show the RL-JACK's resiliency against three SOTA defenses and its transferability across different models. Finally, we validate the insensitivity of RL-JACK to the variations in key hyper-parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLM Meets DRL: Advancing Jailbreaking Efficiency via DRL-guided Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08705v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies developed jailbreaking attacks, which construct jailbreaking prompts to ``fool'' LLMs into responding to harmful questions. Early-stage jailbreaking attacks require access to model internals or significant human efforts. More advanced attacks utilize genetic algorithms for automatic and black-box attacks. However, the random nature of genetic algorithms significantly limits the effectiveness of these attacks. In this paper, we propose RLbreaker, a black-box jailbreaking attack driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We model jailbreaking as a search problem and design an RL agent to guide the search, which is more effective and has less randomness than stochastic search, such as genetic algorithms. Specifically, we design a customized DRL system for the jailbreaking problem, including a novel reward function and a customized proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLbreaker is much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We also show that RLbreaker is robust against three SOTA defenses and its trained agents can transfer across different LLMs. We further validate the key design choices of RLbreaker via a comprehensive ablation study.</p></details> |  |

However, their escalating memory requirements introduce challenges for machine learning (ML) researchers and engineers. Addressing this requires developers to partition a large model to distribute it across multiple GPUs or TPUs. This necessitates considerable coding and intricate configuration efforts with existing model parallel tools, such as Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed, and Alpa. These tools require users' expertise in machine learning systems (MLSys), creating a bottleneck in LLM development, particularly for developers without MLSys background. In this work, we present RedCoast (Redco), a lightweight and user-friendly tool crafted to automate distributed training and inference for LLMs, as well as to simplify ML pipeline development. The design of Redco emphasizes two key aspects. Firstly, to automate model parallelism, our study identifies two straightforward rules to generate tensor parallel strategies for any given LLM. Integrating these rules into Redco facilitates effortless distributed LLM training and inference, eliminating the need of additional coding or complex configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness by applying Redco on a set of LLM architectures, such as GPT-J, LLaMA, T5, and OPT, up to the size of 66B. Secondly, we propose a mechanism that allows for the customization of diverse ML pipelines through the definition of merely three functions, avoiding redundant and formulaic code like multi-host related processing. This mechanism proves adaptable across a spectrum of ML algorithms, from foundational language modeling to complex algorithms like meta-learning and reinforcement learning. As a result, Redco implementations exhibit significantly fewer lines of code compared to their official counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>RedCo...</summary><p>RedCoast (Redco) has been released under Apache License 2.0 at https://github.com/tanyuqian/redco</p></details> |
| **[Ad Auctions for LLMs via Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09459v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of computational advertising, the integration of ads into the outputs of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to support these services without compromising content integrity. This paper introduces novel auction mechanisms for ad allocation and pricing within the textual outputs of LLMs, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a segment auction where an ad is probabilistically retrieved for each discourse segment (paragraph, section, or entire output) according to its bid and relevance, following the RAG framework, and priced according to competing bids. We show that our auction maximizes logarithmic social welfare, a new notion of welfare that balances allocation efficiency and fairness, and we characterize the associated incentive-compatible pricing rule. These results are extended to multi-ad allocation per segment. An empirical evaluation validates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach over several ad auction scenarios, and exhibits inherent tradeoffs in metrics as we allow the LLM more flexibility to allocate ads.</p></details> |  |

This promises to eliminate the need for manually labeled training data and task-specific model training. However, it remains an open question whether tools like ChatGPT can deliver on this promise. In this paper, we show that smaller, fine-tuned LLMs (still) consistently and significantly outperform larger, zero-shot prompted models in text classification. We compare three major generative AI models (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Claude Opus) with several fine-tuned LLMs across a diverse set of classification tasks (sentiment, approval/disapproval, emotions, party positions) and text categories (news, tweets, speeches). We find that fine-tuning with application-specific training data achieves superior performance in all cases. To make this approach more accessible to a broader audience, we provide an easy-to-use toolkit alongside this paper. Our toolkit, accompanied by non-technical step-by-step guidance, enables users to select and fine-tune BERT-like LLMs for any classification task with minimal technical and computational effort.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel two-step Coarse-to-Fine Actor model to address the inherent limitations in conversational and analytical capabilities of small-sized LLMs. Our approach begins with the Policy-based Coarse Actor, employing a technique we term "Continuous Maximization". The Coarse Actor establishes an enhanced, knowledge-rich pool adept at aligning with human preference styles in analysis and reasoning. Through the RLHF process, it employs Continuous Maximization, a strategy that dynamically and adaptively extends the output length limit, enabling the generation of more detailed and analytical content. Subsequently, the Fine Actor refines this analytical content, addressing the generation of excessively redundant information from the Coarse Actor. We introduce a "Knowledge Residue Merger" approach, refining the content from the Coarse Actor and merging it with an existing Instruction model to improve quality, correctness, and reduce redundancies. We applied our methodology to the popular Mistral model, creating Mistral-C2F, which has demonstrated exceptional performance across 11 general language tasks and the MT-Bench Dialogue task, outperforming similar-scale models and even larger models with 13B and 30B parameters. Our model has significantly improved conversational and analytical reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reversing the Forget-Retain Objectives: An Efficient LLM Unlearning Framework from Logit Difference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08607v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate extensive capability in learning from documents, LLM unlearning becomes an increasingly important research area to address concerns of LLMs in terms of privacy, copyright, etc. A conventional LLM unlearning task typically involves two goals: (1) The target LLM should forget the knowledge in the specified forget documents, and (2) it should retain the other knowledge that the LLM possesses, for which we assume access to a small number of retain documents. To achieve both goals, a mainstream class of LLM unlearning methods introduces an optimization framework with a combination of two objectives - maximizing the prediction loss on the forget documents while minimizing that on the retain documents, which suffers from two challenges, degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a novel unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), which introduces an assistant LLM that aims to achieve the opposite of the unlearning goals: remembering the forget documents and forgetting the retain knowledge. ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by computing the logit difference between the target and the assistant LLMs. We show that such reversed objectives would naturally resolve both aforementioned challenges while significantly improving the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method efficiently achieves the intended forgetting while preserving the LLM's overall capabilities, reducing training time by more than threefold. Notably, our method loses 0% of model utility on the ToFU benchmark, whereas baseline methods may sacrifice 17% of utility on average to achieve comparable forget quality. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/ULD.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is the absence of large-scale datasets that provide dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons among future models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the critical role of large-scale 3D-text datasets in advancing embodied AI research. Notably, our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with essential resources and insights, setting the stage for more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> |

Recent approaches attempt to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommendation through a question and answer format, where real users and items (e.g., Item No.2024) are represented with in-vocabulary tokens (e.g., "item", "20", "24"). However, since LLMs are typically pretrained on natural language tasks, these in-vocabulary tokens lack the expressive power for distinctive users and items, thereby weakening the recommendation ability even after fine-tuning on recommendation tasks. In this paper, we explore how to effectively tokenize users and items in LLM-based recommender systems. We emphasize the role of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens in addition to the in-vocabulary ones and claim the memorization of OOV tokens that capture correlations of users/items as well as diversity of OOV tokens. By clustering the learned representations from historical user-item interactions, we make the representations of user/item combinations share the same OOV tokens if they have similar properties. Furthermore, integrating these OOV tokens into the LLM's vocabulary allows for better distinction between users and items and enhanced capture of user-item relationships during fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Our proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various downstream recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magpie: Alignment Data Synthesis from Scratch by Prompting Aligned LLMs with Nothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08464v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality instruction data is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs). Although some models, such as Llama-3-Instruct, have open weights, their alignment data remain private, which hinders the democratization of AI. High human labor costs and a limited, predefined scope for prompting prevent existing open-source data creation methods from scaling effectively, potentially limiting the diversity and quality of public alignment datasets. Is it possible to synthesize high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting it directly from an aligned LLM? We present a self-synthesis method for generating large-scale alignment data named Magpie. Our key observation is that aligned LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct can generate a user query when we input only the left-side templates up to the position reserved for user messages, thanks to their auto-regressive nature. We use this method to prompt Llama-3-Instruct and generate 4 million instructions along with their corresponding responses. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the extracted data and select 300K high-quality instances. To compare Magpie data with other public instruction datasets, we fine-tune Llama-3-8B-Base with each dataset and evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models. Our results indicate that in some tasks, models fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data points through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and subsequent feedback learning. We also show that using Magpie solely for SFT can surpass the performance of previous public datasets utilized for both SFT and preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization with UltraFeedback. This advantage is evident on alignment benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, ArenaHard, and WildBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link:...</summary><p>Link: https://magpie-align.github.io/</p></details> |

Conventional text-to-SQL systems include human engineering and deep neural networks. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed and utilized for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising performance. As modern databases become more complex and corresponding user questions more challenging, PLMs with limited comprehension capabilities can lead to incorrect SQL generation. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which, in turn, restricts the applications of PLM-based systems. Most recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant abilities in natural language understanding as the model scale remains increasing. Therefore, integrating the LLM-based implementation can bring unique opportunities, challenges, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of LLM-based text-to-SQL. Specifically, we propose a brief overview of the current challenges and the evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Then, we provide a detailed introduction to the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. After that, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in this field and propose expectations for future directions.</p></details> |  |

Here, we investigate peoples' perceptions of ChatGPT-generated deceptive behaviour and how this affects peoples' own behaviour and trust. To do this, we use a mixed-methods approach comprising of (i) an online survey with 220 participants and (ii) semi-structured interviews with 12 participants. Our results show that (i) the most common types of deceptive information encountered were over-simplifications and outdated information; (ii) humans' perceptions of trust and `worthiness' of talking to ChatGPT are impacted by `banal' deceptive behaviour; (iii) the perceived responsibility for deception is influenced by education level and the frequency of deceptive information; and (iv) users become more cautious after encountering deceptive information, but they come to trust the technology more when they identify advantages of using it. Our findings contribute to the understanding of human-AI interaction dynamics in the context of \textit{Deceptive AI Ecosystems}, and highlight the importance of user-centric approaches to mitigating the potential harms of deceptive AI technologies.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these limitations, this study innovatively proposes a collaborative training-free reasoning scheme involving tight cooperation between Knowledge Graph (KG) and LLMs. This scheme first involves using LLMs to iteratively explore KG, selectively retrieving a task-relevant knowledge subgraph to support reasoning. The LLMs are then guided to further combine inherent implicit knowledge to reason on the subgraph while explicitly elucidating the reasoning process. Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves more reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the reasoning results. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly progressed across multiple datasets, notably achieving over a 10% improvement on the QALD10 dataset compared to the best baseline and the fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) work. Building on this success, this study hopes to offer a valuable reference for future research in the fusion of KG and LLMs, thereby enhancing LLMs' proficiency in solving complex issues.</p></details> |  |

Currently, as static benchmarks are prone to contamination concerns, users tend to trust human voting platforms, such as Chatbot Arena. However, human annotations require extensive manual efforts. To provide an automatic, robust, and trustworthy evaluation framework, we innovatively propose the Auto-Arena of LLMs, which automates the entire evaluation process with LLM agents. Firstly, an examiner LLM devises queries. Then, a pair of candidate LLMs engage in a multi-round peer-battle around the query, during which the LLM's true performance gaps become visible. Finally, a committee of LLM judges collectively discuss and determine the winner, which alleviates bias and promotes fairness. In our extensive experiment on the 17 newest LLMs, Auto-Arena shows the highest correlation with human preferences, providing a promising alternative to human evaluation platforms.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem, existing work exploits the combination of CPU and GPU for the training process, such as ZeRO-Offload. Such a technique largely democratizes billion-scale model training, making it possible to train with few consumer graphics cards. However, based on our observation, existing frameworks often provide coarse-grained memory management and require experienced experts in configuration tuning, leading to suboptimal hardware utilization and performance. This paper proposes ProTrain, a novel training system that intelligently balances memory usage and performance by coordinating memory, computation, and IO. ProTrain achieves adaptive memory management through Chunk-Based Model State Management and Block-Wise Activation Management, guided by a Memory-Aware Runtime Profiler without user intervention. ProTrain does not change the training algorithm and thus does not compromise accuracy. Experiments show that ProTrain improves training throughput by 1.43$\times$ to 2.71$\times$ compared to the SOTA training systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the dynamic heterogeneous networks (DHNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed anomaly detection methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for DHNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM), incorporating semantic rule trees with an attention mechanism to address the multi-scale anomaly detection problem in DHNs. Secondly, a chain-of-thought-based large language model is embedded in downstream to adaptively analyze the fault detection results and produce an analysis report with detailed fault information and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed MSADM for heterogeneous network entity anomaly detection is as high as 91.31\%.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, effective congestion management is imperative, with traffic signal control (TSC) systems being pivotal in this endeavor. Conventional TSC systems, designed upon rule-based algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL), frequently exhibit deficiencies in managing the complexities and variabilities of urban traffic flows, constrained by their limited capacity for adaptation to unfamiliar scenarios. In response to these limitations, this work introduces an innovative approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into TSC, harnessing their advanced reasoning and decision-making faculties. Specifically, a hybrid framework that augments LLMs with a suite of perception and decision-making tools is proposed, facilitating the interrogation of both the static and dynamic traffic information. This design places the LLM at the center of the decision-making process, combining external traffic data with established TSC methods. Moreover, a simulation platform is developed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The findings from our simulations attest to the system's adeptness in adjusting to a multiplicity of traffic environments without the need for additional training. Notably, in cases of Sensor Outage (SO), our approach surpasses conventional RL-based systems by reducing the average waiting time by $20.4\%$. This research signifies a notable advance in TSC strategies and paves the way for the integration of LLMs into real-world, dynamic scenarios, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traffic management.

Questions, however, persist about the nature of LLMs and their potential to integrate common-sense human knowledge when performing tasks involving information about the real physical world. This paper delves into these questions by exploring how LLMs can be extended to interact with and reason about the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, a concept that we term "Penetrative AI". The paper explores such an extension at two levels of LLMs' ability to penetrate into the physical world via the processing of sensory signals. Our preliminary findings indicate that LLMs, with ChatGPT being the representative example in our exploration, have considerable and unique proficiency in employing the embedded world knowledge for interpreting IoT sensor data and reasoning over them about tasks in the physical realm. Not only this opens up new applications for LLMs beyond traditional text-based tasks, but also enables new ways of incorporating human knowledge in cyber-physical systems.</p></details> | ACL Findings 2024 |

Their knowledge is then commonly evaluated using static benchmarks. However, factual knowledge is generally subject to time-sensitive changes, and static benchmarks cannot address those cases. We present an approach to dynamically evaluate the knowledge in LLMs and their time-sensitiveness against Wikidata, a publicly available up-to-date knowledge graph. We evaluate the time-sensitive knowledge in twenty-four private and open-source LLMs, as well as the effectiveness of four editing methods in updating the outdated facts. Our results show that 1) outdatedness is a critical problem across state-of-the-art LLMs; 2) LLMs output inconsistent answers when prompted with slight variations of the question prompt; and 3) the performance of the state-of-the-art knowledge editing algorithms is very limited, as they can not reduce the cases of outdatedness and output inconsistency.</p></details> |  |

Current bias mitigation methods such as RLHF usually rely on costly human feedback, lack transferability to other topics, and show poor performance. We find that informing the LLMs that their generated content is not generated by them and querying about potential biases greatly boosts their awareness and ability to mitigate biases. Based on this, we propose RLDF (Reinforcement Learning from Multi-role Debates as Feedback), replacing human feedback with AI for bias mitigation. RLDF engages LLMs in multi-role debates to expose biases and gradually reduce biases in each iteration using a ranking scoring mechanism. The dialogue are then used to create a dataset composed of both high bias and low bias instances to train the reward model in reinforcement learning. This dataset can be generated by the same LLM for self-reflection or a superior LLM like an API which guides the former one in a teacher-student mode. Experimental results across different LLMs and types of bias show the effectiveness of our approach in bias mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

For the elicitation and validation of requirements, GUI prototyping is a well-known and effective technique, typically employed after gathering initial user requirements represented in natural language (NL) (e.g., in the form of user stories). Unfortunately, GUI prototyping often requires extensive resources, resulting in a costly and time-consuming process. Despite various easy-to-use prototyping tools in practice, there is often a lack of adequate resources for developing GUI prototypes based on given user requirements. In this work, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based approach providing assistance for validating the implementation of functional NL-based requirements in a GUI prototype embedded in a prototyping tool. In particular, our approach aims to detect functional user stories that are not implemented in a GUI prototype and provides recommendations for suitable GUI components directly implementing the requirements. We collected requirements for existing GUIs in the form of user stories and evaluated our proposed validation and recommendation approach with this dataset. The obtained results are promising for user story validation and we demonstrate feasibility for the GUI component recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Previous deepfake audio generation methods typically involve a multi-step generation process, with the final step using a vocoder to predict the waveform from handcrafted features. However, LLM-based audio is directly generated from discrete neural codecs in an end-to-end generation process, skipping the final step of vocoder processing. This poses a significant challenge for current audio deepfake detection (ADD) models based on vocoder artifacts. To effectively detect LLM-based deepfake audio, we focus on the core of the generation process, the conversion from neural codec to waveform. We propose Codecfake dataset, which is generated by seven representative neural codec methods. Experiment results show that codec-trained ADD models exhibit a 41.406% reduction in average equal error rate compared to vocoder-trained ADD models on the Codecfake test set.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.04880</p></details> |

Lessons from generics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06590v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent scholarship on reasoning in LLMs has supplied evidence of impressive performance and flexible adaptation to machine generated or human feedback. Nonmonotonic reasoning, crucial to human cognition for navigating the real world, remains a challenging, yet understudied task. In this work, we study nonmonotonic reasoning capabilities of seven state-of-the-art LLMs in one abstract and one commonsense reasoning task featuring generics, such as 'Birds fly', and exceptions, 'Penguins don't fly' (see Fig. 1). While LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns in accordance with human nonmonotonic reasoning abilities, they fail to maintain stable beliefs on truth conditions of generics at the addition of supporting examples ('Owls fly') or unrelated information ('Lions have manes'). Our findings highlight pitfalls in attributing human reasoning behaviours to LLMs, as well as assessing general capabilities, while consistent reasoning remains elusive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2024 (main)</p></details> |
| **[Optimized Feature Generation for Tabular Data via LLMs with Decision Tree Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08527v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective representations from raw data is crucial for the success of deep learning methods. However, in the tabular domain, practitioners often prefer augmenting raw column features over using learned representations, as conventional tree-based algorithms frequently outperform competing approaches. As a result, feature engineering methods that automatically generate candidate features have been widely used. While these approaches are often effective, there remains ambiguity in defining the space over which to search for candidate features. Moreover, they often rely solely on validation scores to select good features, neglecting valuable feedback from past experiments that could inform the planning of future experiments. To address the shortcomings, we propose a new tabular learning framework based on large language models (LLMs), coined Optimizing Column feature generator with decision Tree reasoning (OCTree). Our key idea is to leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities to find good feature generation rules without manually specifying the search space and provide language-based reasoning information highlighting past experiments as feedback for iterative rule improvements. Here, we choose a decision tree as reasoning as it can be interpreted in natural language, effectively conveying knowledge of past experiments (i.e., the prediction models trained with the generated features) to the LLM. Our empirical results demonstrate that this simple framework consistently enhances the performance of various prediction models across diverse tabular benchmarks, outperforming competing automatic feature engineering methods.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Guiding In-Context Learning of LLMs through Quality Estimation for Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07970v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of output from large language models (LLMs), particularly in machine translation (MT), is closely tied to the quality of in-context examples (ICEs) provided along with the query, i.e., the text to translate. The effectiveness of these ICEs is influenced by various factors, such as the domain of the source text, the order in which the ICEs are presented, the number of these examples, and the prompt templates used. Naturally, selecting the most impactful ICEs depends on understanding how these affect the resulting translation quality, which ultimately relies on translation references or human judgment. This paper presents a novel methodology for in-context learning (ICL) that relies on a search algorithm guided by domain-specific quality estimation (QE). Leveraging the XGLM model, our methodology estimates the resulting translation quality without the need for translation references, selecting effective ICEs for MT to maximize translation quality. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over existing ICL methods and higher translation performance compared to fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (PLM), specifically mBART-50.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPIC: Decoupling Prompt and Intrinsic Characteristics for LLM Generated Text Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12519v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to generate texts that pose risks of misuse, such as plagiarism, planting fake reviews on e-commerce platforms, or creating inflammatory false tweets. Consequently, detecting whether a text is generated by LLMs has become increasingly important. Existing high-quality detection methods usually require access to the interior of the model to extract the intrinsic characteristics. However, since we do not have access to the interior of the black-box model, we must resort to surrogate models, which impacts detection quality. In order to achieve high-quality detection of black-box models, we would like to extract deep intrinsic characteristics of the black-box model generated texts. We view the generation process as a coupled process of prompt and intrinsic characteristics of the generative model. Based on this insight, we propose to decouple prompt and intrinsic characteristics (DPIC) for LLM-generated text detection method. Specifically, given a candidate text, DPIC employs an auxiliary LLM to reconstruct the prompt corresponding to the candidate text, then uses the prompt to regenerate text by the auxiliary LLM, which makes the candidate text and the regenerated text align with their prompts, respectively. Then, the similarity between the candidate text and the regenerated text is used as a detection feature, thus eliminating the prompt in the detection process, which allows the detector to focus on the intrinsic characteristics of the generative model. Compared to the baselines, DPIC has achieved an average improvement of 6.76\% and 2.91\% in detecting texts from different domains generated by GPT4 and Claude3, respectively.</p></details> |  |

To study this problem, we organized a capture-the-flag competition at IEEE SaTML 2024, where the flag is a secret string in the LLM system prompt. The competition was organized in two phases. In the first phase, teams developed defenses to prevent the model from leaking the secret. During the second phase, teams were challenged to extract the secrets hidden for defenses proposed by the other teams. This report summarizes the main insights from the competition. Notably, we found that all defenses were bypassed at least once, highlighting the difficulty of designing a successful defense and the necessity for additional research to protect LLM systems. To foster future research in this direction, we compiled a dataset with over 137k multi-turn attack chats and open-sourced the platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eliciting Better Multilingual Structured Reasoning from LLMs through Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02567v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLM) has shown progress on reasoning, though studies have largely considered either English or simple reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce a multilingual structured reasoning and explanation dataset, termed xSTREET, that covers four tasks across six languages. xSTREET exposes a gap in base LLM performance between English and non-English reasoning tasks. We then propose two methods to remedy this gap, building on the insight that LLMs trained on code are better reasoners. First, at training time, we augment a code dataset with multilingual comments using machine translation while keeping program code as-is. Second, at inference time, we bridge the gap between training and inference by employing a prompt structure that incorporates step-by-step code primitives to derive new facts and find a solution. Our methods show improved multilingual performance on xSTREET, most notably on the scientific commonsense reasoning subtask. Furthermore, the models show no regression on non-reasoning tasks, thus demonstrating our techniques maintain general-purpose abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLLens: Testing Deep Learning Libraries via LLM-aided Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing is a major approach to ensuring the quality of deep learning (DL) libraries. Existing testing techniques commonly adopt differential testing to relieve the need for test oracle construction. However, these techniques are limited in finding implementations that offer the same functionality and generating diverse test inputs for differential testing. This paper introduces DLLens, a novel differential testing technique for DL library testing. Our insight is that APIs in different DL libraries are commonly designed to accomplish various computations for the same set of published DL algorithms. Although the mapping of these APIs is not often one-to-one, we observe that their computations can be mutually simulated after proper composition and adaptation. The use of these simulation counterparts facilitates differential testing for the detection of functional DL library bugs. Leveraging the insight, we propose DLLens as a novel mechanism that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to synthesize valid counterparts of DL library APIs. To generate diverse test inputs, DLLens incorporates a static analysis method aided by LLM to extract path constraints from all execution paths in each API and its counterpart's implementations. These path constraints are then used to guide the generation of diverse test inputs. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens can synthesize counterparts for more than twice as many APIs found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, DLLens can extract 26.7% more constraints and detect 2.5 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques. DLLens has successfully found 56 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 41 are previously unknown, 39 of which have been confirmed by developers after reporting, and 19 of those confirmed bugs have been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[How You Prompt Matters! Even Task-Oriented Constraints in Instructions Affect LLM-Generated Text Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08369v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To combat the misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), many recent studies have presented LLM-generated-text detectors with promising performance. When users instruct LLMs to generate texts, the instruction can include different constraints depending on the user's need. However, most recent studies do not cover such diverse instruction patterns when creating datasets for LLM detection. In this paper, we reveal that even task-oriented constraints -- constraints that would naturally be included in an instruction and are not related to detection-evasion -- cause existing powerful detectors to have a large variance in detection performance. We focus on student essay writing as a realistic domain and manually create task-oriented constraints based on several factors for essay quality. Our experiments show that the standard deviation (SD) of current detector performance on texts generated by an instruction with such a constraint is significantly larger (up to an SD of 14.4 F1-score) than that by generating texts multiple times or paraphrasing the instruction. We also observe an overall trend where the constraints can make LLM detection more challenging than without them. Finally, our analysis indicates that the high instruction-following ability of LLMs fosters the large impact of such constraints on detection performance.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Stronger, Cheaper and Demonstration-Free Log Parsing with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06156v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log parsing, the process of converting raw log messages into structured formats, is an important initial step for automated analysis of logs of large-scale software systems. Traditional log parsers often rely on heuristics or handcrafted features, which may not generalize well across diverse log sources or require extensive model tuning. Recently, some log parsers have utilized powerful generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, they heavily rely on demonstration examples, resulting in substantial overhead in LLM invocations. To address these issues, we propose LogBatcher, a cost-effective LLM-based log parser that requires no training process or labeled data. To leverage latent characteristics of log data and reduce the overhead, we divide logs into several partitions through clustering. Then we perform a cache matching process to match logs with previously parsed log templates. Finally, we provide LLMs with better prompt context specialized for log parsing by batching a group of logs from each partition. We have conducted experiments on 16 public log datasets and the results show that LogBatcher is effective and efficient for log parsing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Throughput-Latency Tradeoff in LLM Inference with Sarathi-Serve](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02310v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Each LLM serving request goes through two phases. The first is prefill which processes the entire input prompt and produces the first output token and the second is decode which generates the rest of output tokens, one-at-a-time. Prefill iterations have high latency but saturate GPU compute due to parallel processing of the input prompt. In contrast, decode iterations have low latency but also low compute utilization because a decode iteration processes only a single token per request. This makes batching highly effective for decodes and consequently for overall throughput. However, batching multiple requests leads to an interleaving of prefill and decode iterations which makes it challenging to achieve both high throughput and low latency. We introduce an efficient LLM inference scheduler, Sarathi-Serve, to address this throughput-latency tradeoff. Sarathi-Serve introduces chunked-prefills which splits a prefill request into near equal sized chunks and creates stall-free schedules that adds new requests in a batch without pausing ongoing decodes. Stall-free scheduling unlocks the opportunity to improve throughput with large batch sizes while minimizing the effect of batching on latency. Furthermore, uniform batches in Sarathi-Serve ameliorate the imbalance between iterations resulting in minimal pipeline bubbles. Our techniques yield significant improvements in inference performance across models and hardware under tail latency constraints. For Mistral-7B on single A100 GPUs, we achieve 2.6x higher serving capacity and up to 3.7x higher serving capacity for the Yi-34B model on two A100 GPUs as compared to vLLM. When used with pipeline parallelism on Falcon-180B, Sarathi-Serve provides up to 5.6x gain in the end-to-end serving capacity. The source code for Sarathi-Serve is available at https://github.com/microsoft/sarathi-serve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know Your Needs Better: Towards Structured Understanding of Marketer Demands with Analogical Reasoning Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04319v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore a new way for user targeting, where non-expert marketers could select their target users solely given demands in natural language form. The key to this issue is how to transform natural languages into practical structured logical languages, i.e., the structured understanding of marketer demands. In practical scenarios, the demands of non-expert marketers are often abstract and diverse. Considering the impressive natural language processing ability of large language models (LLMs), we try to leverage LLMs to solve this issue. To stimulate the LLMs' reasoning ability, the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method is widely used, but existing methods still have some limitations in our scenario: (1) Previous methods either use simple "Let's think step by step" spells or provide fixed examples in demonstrations without considering compatibility between prompts and concrete questions, making LLMs ineffective when the marketers' demands are abstract and diverse. (2) Previous methods are often implemented in closed-source models or excessively large models, which is not suitable in industrial practical scenarios. Based on these, we propose ARALLM (i.e., Analogical Reasoning Augmented Large Language Models) consisting of two modules: Analogical Reasoning based Prompting and Reasoning-Augmented Multi-Task Model Distillation. Part of our data and code can be found at https://github.com/alipay/Analogic-Reasoning-Augmented-Large-Language-Model.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Some models like Gemini could even to be capable of dealing with millions of tokens. However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their true abilities in more challenging, real-world scenarios. We introduce a benchmark (LongICLBench) for long in-context learning in extreme-label classification using six datasets with 28 to 174 classes and input lengths from 2K to 50K tokens. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct predictions. We evaluate on 15 long-context LLMs and find that they perform well on less challenging classification tasks with smaller label space and shorter demonstrations. However, they struggle with more challenging task like Discovery with 174 labels, suggesting a gap in their ability to process long, context-rich sequences. Further analysis reveals a bias towards labels presented later in the sequence and a need for improved reasoning over multiple pieces of information. Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs. We believe LongICLBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long-context LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLEB: Streamlining LLMs through Redundancy Verification and Elimination of Transformer Blocks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09025v4)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be highly effective across various natural language processing tasks. However, their large number of parameters poses significant challenges for practical deployment. Pruning, a technique aimed at reducing the size and complexity of LLMs, offers a potential solution by removing redundant components from the network. Despite the promise of pruning, existing methods often struggle to achieve substantial end-to-end LLM inference speedup. In this paper, we introduce SLEB, a novel approach designed to streamline LLMs by eliminating redundant transformer blocks. We choose the transformer block as the fundamental unit for pruning, because LLMs exhibit block-level redundancy with high similarity between the outputs of neighboring blocks. This choice allows us to effectively enhance the processing speed of LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SLEB outperforms previous LLM pruning methods in accelerating LLM inference while also maintaining superior perplexity and accuracy, making SLEB as a promising technique for enhancing the efficiency of LLMs. The code is available at: https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/SLEB.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Can't Plan, But Can Help Planning in LLM-Modulo Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01817v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is considerable confusion about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in planning and reasoning tasks. On one side are over-optimistic claims that LLMs can indeed do these tasks with just the right prompting or self-verification strategies. On the other side are perhaps over-pessimistic claims that all that LLMs are good for in planning/reasoning tasks are as mere translators of the problem specification from one syntactic format to another, and ship the problem off to external symbolic solvers. In this position paper, we take the view that both these extremes are misguided. We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of {\bf LLM-Modulo Frameworks} that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the models driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components, and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.</p></details> |  |

Our study investigates this issue by developing a framework to systematically study and quantify position bias using metrics such as repetitional consistency, positional consistency, and positional fairness. We conduct experiments with 9 judge models across 22 tasks from the MTBench and DevBench benchmarks and nearly 40 answer-generating models, generating approximately 80,000 evaluation instances. This comprehensive assessment reveals significant variations in bias across judges and tasks. Although GPT-4 often excels in positional consistency and fairness, some more cost-effective models perform comparably or even better in specific tasks, highlighting essential trade-offs between consistency, fairness, and cost. Our results also demonstrate high consistency of judgment across repetitions, confirming that position bias is not due to random variations. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluation. These insights guide the selection of optimal judge models, enhance benchmark design, and lay the foundation for future research into effective debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluators.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, around 200 figures and subfigures</p></details> |

Unfortunately, there has been a rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content, such alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment-breaking attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In this work, we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against potential alignment-breaking attacks. RA-LLM can be directly constructed upon an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function, without requiring any expensive retraining or fine-tuning process of the original LLM. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA-LLM to verify its effectiveness in defending against alignment-breaking attacks. Through real-world experiments on open-source large language models, we demonstrate that RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 100% to around 10% or less.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 5 Figures, 8 Tables.

Despite its advancements, current methods using trigger phrases such as "Let's think step by step" remain limited. This study introduces PRomPTed, an approach that optimizes the zero-shot prompts for individual task instances following an innovative manner of "LLMs in the loop". Our comprehensive evaluation across 13 datasets and 10 task types based on GPT-4 reveals that PRomPTed significantly outperforms both the naive zero-shot approaches and a strong baseline (i.e., "Output Refinement") which refines the task output instead of the input prompt. Our experimental results also confirmed the generalization of this advantage to the relatively weaker GPT-3.5. Even more intriguingly, we found that leveraging GPT-3.5 to rewrite prompts for the stronger GPT-4 not only matches but occasionally exceeds the efficacy of using GPT-4 as the prompt rewriter. Our research thus presents a huge value in not only enhancing zero-shot LLM performance but also potentially enabling supervising LLMs with their weaker counterparts, a capability attracting much interest recently. Finally, our additional experiments confirm the generalization of the advantages to open-source LLMs such as Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2024 - Findings</p></details> |

We specifically target the challenge of deploying these models on resource-constrained devices. Our methodology involves training the smaller student model (Neural Network) using the prediction probabilities (as soft labels) of the LLM, which serves as a teacher model. This is achieved through a specialized loss function tailored to learn from the LLM's output probabilities, ensuring that the student model closely mimics the teacher's performance. To validate the performance of the KD approach, we utilized a large dataset, 7T, containing 6,684 student-written responses to science questions and three mathematical reasoning datasets with student-written responses graded by human experts. We compared accuracy with state-of-the-art (SOTA) distilled models, TinyBERT, and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Results have shown that the KD approach has 3% and 2% higher scoring accuracy than ANN and TinyBERT, respectively, and comparable accuracy to the teacher model. Furthermore, the student model size is 0.03M, 4,000 times smaller in parameters and x10 faster in inferencing than the teacher model and TinyBERT, respectively. The significance of this research lies in its potential to make advanced AI technologies accessible in typical educational settings, particularly for automatic scoring.</p></details> | Accepted to AIED2024 |

Typically, an LLM is given a question and selects the answer deemed most probable after adjustments for factors like length. Unfortunately, LLMs may inherently favor certain answer choice IDs, such as A/B/C/D, due to inherent biases of priori unbalanced probabilities, influencing the prediction of answers based on these IDs. Previous research has introduced methods to reduce this ''selection bias'' by simply permutating options on a few test samples and applying to new ones. Another problem of MCQ is the lottery ticket choice by ''random guessing''. The LLM does not learn particular knowledge, but the option is guessed correctly. This situation is especially serious for those small-scale LLMs. To address them, a more thorough approach involves shifting from MCQ to open-style questions, which can fundamentally eliminate selection bias and random guessing issues. However, transitioning causes its own set of challenges in (1) identifying suitable open-style questions and (2) validating the correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated ground-truths. This work aims to tackle these significant difficulties, and establish a new LLM evaluation benchmark through entirely open-style questions. Consequently, we introduce the Open-LLM-Leaderboard to track various LLMs' performance and reflect true capability of them, such as GPT-4o/4/3.5, Claude 3, Gemini, etc. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard</p></details> |

This blurring of lines between machine- and human-written text presents new challenges in distinguishing one from the other a task further complicated by the frequent updates and closed nature of leading proprietary LLMs. Traditional logits-based detection methods leverage surrogate models for identifying LLM-generated content when the exact logits are unavailable from black-box LLMs. However, these methods grapple with the misalignment between the distributions of the surrogate and the often undisclosed target models, leading to performance degradation, particularly with the introduction of new, closed-source models. Furthermore, while current methodologies are generally effective when the source model is identified, they falter in scenarios where the model version remains unknown, or the test set comprises outputs from various source models. To address these limitations, we present Distribution-Aligned LLMs Detection (DALD), an innovative framework that redefines the state-of-the-art performance in black-box text detection even without logits from source LLMs. DALD is designed to align the surrogate model's distribution with that of unknown target LLMs, ensuring enhanced detection capability and resilience against rapid model iterations with minimal training investment. By leveraging corpus samples from publicly accessible outputs of advanced models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Claude-3, DALD fine-tunes surrogate models to synchronize with unknown source model distributions effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding LLM Temporal Logic Generation with Explicit Separation of Data and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07400v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal logics are powerful tools that are widely used for the synthesis and verification of reactive systems. The recent progress on Large Language Models (LLMs) has the potential to make the process of writing such specifications more accessible. However, writing specifications in temporal logics remains challenging for all but the most expert users. A key question in using LLMs for temporal logic specification engineering is to understand what kind of guidance is most helpful to the LLM and the users to easily produce specifications. Looking specifically at the problem of reactive program synthesis, we explore the impact of providing an LLM with guidance on the separation of control and data--making explicit for the LLM what functionality is relevant for the specification, and treating the remaining functionality as an implementation detail for a series of pre-defined functions and predicates. We present a benchmark set and find that this separation of concerns improves specification generation. Our benchmark provides a test set against which to verify future work in LLM generation of temporal logic specifications.</p></details> |  |

Shift-and-add reparameterization offers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with hardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require training from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which is resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating pretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization, creating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM. Specifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with group-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized into (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and adds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a multi-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output activation reparameterization errors. Additionally, based on varying sensitivity across layers to reparameterization, we develop an automated bit allocation strategy to further reduce memory usage and latency. Experiments on five LLM families and eight tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddLLM, achieving average perplexity improvements of 5.6 and 22.7 points at comparable or lower latency compared to the most competitive quantized LLMs at 3 and 2 bits, respectively, and more than 80% memory and energy reductions over the original LLMs. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/ShiftAddLLM.</p></details> |  |

The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To keep LLMs current, existing approaches typically involve continued pre-training on new documents. However, they frequently face difficulties in extracting stored knowledge. Motivated by the remarkable success of the Feynman Technique in efficient human learning, we introduce Self-Tuning, a learning framework aimed at improving an LLM's ability to effectively acquire new knowledge from raw documents through self-teaching. Specifically, we develop a Self-Teaching strategy that augments the documents with a set of knowledge-intensive tasks created in a self-supervised manner, focusing on three crucial aspects: memorization, comprehension, and self-reflection. Additionally, we introduce three Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA datasets to facilitate an in-depth analysis of an LLM's knowledge acquisition ability concerning memorization, extraction, and reasoning. Extensive experimental results on Llama2 family models reveal that Self-Tuning consistently exhibits superior performance across all knowledge acquisition tasks and excels in preserving previous knowledge.</p></details> | 30 pages |

GMNER task exhibits two challenging attributes: 1) The tenuous correlation between images and text on social media contributes to a notable proportion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained noun phrases used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as connecting bridges. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It enables us to optimize the MNER module for optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need to pre-extract region features using object detection methods, thus naturally addressing the two major limitations of existing GMNER methods. 2) The introduction of Entity Expansion Expression module and Visual Entailment (VE) module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). This endows the proposed framework with unlimited data and model scalability. Furthermore, to address the potential ambiguity stemming from the coarse-grained bounding box output in GMNER, we further construct the new Segmented Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (SMNER) task and corresponding Twitter-SMNER dataset aimed at generating fine-grained segmentation masks, and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using box prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to empower any GMNER model with the ability to accomplish the SMNER task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG significantly outperforms SoTA methods on four datasets across the MNER, GMNER, and SMNER tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of our Findings of EMNLP 2023 & ACL 2024 paper</p></details> |

While safety fine-tuning typically takes place in English, if at all, these models are being used by speakers of many different languages. There is existing evidence that the performance of these models is inconsistent across languages and that they discriminate based on demographic factors of the user. Motivated by this, we investigate whether the social stereotypes exhibited by LLMs differ as a function of the language used to prompt them, while controlling for cultural differences and task accuracy. To this end, we present MBBQ (Multilingual Bias Benchmark for Question-answering), a carefully curated version of the English BBQ dataset extended to Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish, which measures stereotypes commonly held across these languages. We further complement MBBQ with a parallel control dataset to measure task performance on the question-answering task independently of bias. Our results based on several open-source and proprietary LLMs confirm that some non-English languages suffer from bias more than English, even when controlling for cultural shifts. Moreover, we observe significant cross-lingual differences in bias behaviour for all except the most accurate models. With the release of MBBQ, we hope to encourage further research on bias in multilingual settings. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Veranep/MBBQ.</p></details> |  |

To address these hallucinations, current approaches typically necessitate high-quality human factuality annotations. In this work, we explore Self-Alignment for Factuality, where we leverage the self-evaluation capability of an LLM to provide training signals that steer the model towards factuality. Specifically, we incorporate Self-Eval, a self-evaluation component, to prompt an LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses solely based on its internal knowledge. Additionally, we design Self-Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) to augment the LLM's self-evaluation ability by improving the model's confidence estimation and calibration. We then utilize these self-annotated responses to fine-tune the model via Direct Preference Optimization algorithm. We show that the proposed self-alignment approach substantially enhances factual accuracy over Llama family models across three key knowledge-intensive tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN.</p></details> | 20 pages |

On the other hand, personalized LLM response generation holds the potential to offer substantial benefits for individuals in critical areas such as medical. Existing research has explored memory-augmented methods to prompt the LLM with pre-stored user-specific knowledge for personalized response generation in terms of new queries. We contend that such paradigm is unable to perceive fine-granularity information. In this study, we propose a novel \textbf{M}emory-\textbf{i}njected approach using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and along with a Bayesian Optimisation searching strategy to achieve \textbf{L}LM \textbf{P}ersonalization(\textbf{MiLP}).</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA, which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First, a Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content, ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second, our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases, in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation, in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method, marking a significant improvement over prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024, Project Page: https://dsl-fiqa.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a Meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based SISR approach to learn kernel priors from organized randomness. In concrete, a lightweight network is adopted as kernel generator, and is optimized via learning from the MCMC simulation on random Gaussian distributions. This procedure provides an approximation for the rational blur kernel, and introduces a network-level Langevin dynamics into SISR optimization processes, which contributes to preventing bad local optimal solutions for kernel estimation. Meanwhile, a meta-learning-based alternating optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the kernel generator and image restorer, respectively. In contrast to the conventional alternating minimization strategy, a meta-learning-based framework is applied to learn an adaptive optimization strategy, which is less-greedy and results in better convergence performance. These two procedures are iteratively processed in a plug-and-play fashion, for the first time, realizing a learning-based but plug-and-play blind SISR solution in unsupervised inference. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of the proposed approach when comparing with state-of-the-arts on synthesis and real-world datasets.

Traditional methods often falter with variable document types, leading to poor performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a text-graphic layer separation approach that enhances domain adaptability in document image restoration (DIR) systems. We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study. Initially trained on a synthetically generated dataset, our model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for the DIR task, offering a promising solution for handling variability in real-world data.

In this paper, we present Deep Degradation Response (DDR), a method to quantify changes in image deep features under varying degradation conditions. Specifically, our approach facilitates flexible and adaptive degradation, enabling the controlled synthesis of image degradation through text-driven prompts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution.

Improvement in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction has been achieved by integrating Swin Image Restoration (SwinIR) based sinogram and image enhancement modules. The proposed methodology uses Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG) to solve the least squares (NAG-LS) problem in CT image reconstruction. The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction. The averaged mean squared error (MSE) over the validation dataset has decreased significantly, in the case of low dose by one-fifth and clinical dose by one-tenth. Our solution is one of the top 5 approaches in this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemosaicFormer: Coarse-to-Fine Demosaicing Network for HybridEVS Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07951v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid Event-Based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) is a novel sensor integrating traditional frame-based and event-based sensors, offering substantial benefits for applications requiring low-light, high dynamic range, and low-latency environments, such as smartphones and wearable devices. Despite its potential, the lack of Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline specifically designed for HybridEVS poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework named DemosaicFormer which comprises coarse demosaicing and pixel correction. Coarse demosaicing network is designed to produce a preliminary high-quality estimate of the RGB image from the HybridEVS raw data while the pixel correction network enhances the performance of image restoration and mitigates the impact of defective pixels. Our key innovation is the design of a Multi-Scale Gating Module (MSGM) applying the integration of cross-scale features, which allows feature information to flow between different scales. Additionally, the adoption of progressive training and data augmentation strategies further improves model's robustness and effectiveness. Experimental results show superior performance against the existing methods both qualitatively and visually, and our DemosaicFormer achieves the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics in the MIPI 2024 challenge on Demosaic for Hybridevs Camera.

Data aggregation as well as high-resolution image generation both usually come at the risk of involving aliases, i.e.~standard architectures put their ability to reconstruct the model input in jeopardy to reach high PSNR values on validation data. The price to be paid is low model robustness. In this work, we show that simply providing alias-free paths in state-of-the-art reconstruction transformers supports improved model robustness at low costs on the restoration performance. We do so by proposing BOA-Restormer, a transformer-based image restoration model that executes downsampling and upsampling operations partly in the frequency domain to ensure alias-free paths along the entire model while potentially preserving all relevant high-frequency information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tags:...</summary><p>Tags: Adversarial attack, image restoration, image deblurring, frequency sampling</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

| **[The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253v4)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding Image Priors through Sparse Generators at Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05288v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Optimal Eye Surgeon (OES), a framework for pruning and training deep image generator networks. Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors (Ulyanov et al., 2018). However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy images, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.

In this paper, we propose lightweight diffusion models for image inpainting that can be trained on a single image, or a few images. We show that our approach competes with large state-of-the-art models in specific cases. We also show that training a model on a single image is particularly relevant for image acquisition modality that differ from the RGB images of standard learning databases. We show results in three different contexts: texture images, line drawing images, and materials BRDF, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of realism, with a computational load that is greatly reduced compared to concurrent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Test-Time Degradation Adaptation for Open-Set Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02197v4)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrast to close-set scenarios that restore images from a predefined set of degradations, open-set image restoration aims to handle the unknown degradations that were unforeseen during the pretraining phase, which is less-touched as far as we know. This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image restoration, which consists of three components, \textit{i.e.}, i) a pre-trained and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods.

We first propose an extrapolated DYS method to effectively solve a class of structural nonconvex optimization problems that involve minimizing the sum of three possible nonconvex functions. Our approach provides an algorithmic framework that encompasses both extrapolated forward-backward splitting and extrapolated Douglas-Rachford splitting methods. To establish the convergence of the proposed method, we rigorously analyze its behavior based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, subject to some tight parameter conditions. Moreover, we introduce two extrapolated PnP-DYS methods with convergence guarantee, where the traditional regularization prior is replaced by a gradient step-based denoiser. This denoiser is designed using a differentiable neural network and can be reformulated as the proximal operator of a specific nonconvex functional. We conduct extensive experiments on image deblurring and image super-resolution problems, where our results showcase the advantage of the extrapolation strategy and the superior performance of the learning-based model that incorporates the PnP denoiser in terms of achieving high-quality recovery images.</p></details> | 37 Pages |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 6 tables |
| **[Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Matching Transformation Transformers for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00629v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring. The source codes will be made available at https://github.com/supersupercong/UHDformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-24; Source codes, datasets, visual results, and pre-trained models are: https://github.com/supersupercong/UHDformer</p></details> |

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the efficacy of learning large models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously. Nonetheless, these approaches introduce considerable computational overhead and complex learning paradigms, limiting their practical utility. In response, we propose \textit{DaAIR}, an efficient All-in-One image restorer employing a Degradation-aware Learner (DaLe) in the low-rank regime to collaboratively mine shared aspects and subtle nuances across diverse degradations, generating a degradation-aware embedding. By dynamically allocating model capacity to input degradations, we realize an efficient restorer integrating holistic and specific learning within a unified model. Furthermore, DaAIR introduces a cost-efficient parameter update mechanism that enhances degradation awareness while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive comparisons across five image degradations demonstrate that our DaAIR outperforms both state-of-the-art All-in-One models and degradation-specific counterparts, affirming our efficacy and practicality.

| **[Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17161v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.

| **[Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific restoration or enhancement problems, and do not fully explore the potential of utilizing multiple images. Motivated by the fact that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to unify image restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the Vision Transformers (ViTs) emergence has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR) tasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation operator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common characteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling process in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This choice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored image to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054v5)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

AutoDIR excels in its ability to automatically identify and restore images suffering from a range of unknown degradations. AutoDIR offers intuitive open-vocabulary image editing, empowering users to customize and enhance images according to their preferences. Specifically, AutoDIR consists of two key stages: a Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) stage based on a semantic-agnostic vision-language model which automatically detects unknown image degradations for input images, an All-in-One Image Restoration (AIR) stage utilizes structural-corrected latent diffusion which handles multiple types of image degradations. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that AutoDIR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for a wider range of image restoration tasks. The design of AutoDIR also enables flexible user control (via text prompt) and generalization to new tasks as a foundation model of image restoration.

| **[Fast Samplers for Inverse Problems in Iterative Refinement Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17673v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mandt-lab/CI2RM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Uncertainty Exploration via Feedforward Posterior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15719v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When solving ill-posed inverse problems, one often desires to explore the space of potential solutions rather than be presented with a single plausible reconstruction. Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using tree-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Blaze3DM: Marry Triplane Representation with Diffusion for 3D Medical Inverse Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15241v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving 3D medical inverse problems such as image restoration and reconstruction is crucial in modern medical field. However, the curse of dimensionality in 3D medical data leads mainstream volume-wise methods to suffer from high resource consumption and challenges models to successfully capture the natural distribution, resulting in inevitable volume inconsistency and artifacts. Some recent works attempt to simplify generation in the latent space but lack the capability to efficiently model intricate image details. To address these limitations, we present Blaze3DM, a novel approach that enables fast and high-fidelity generation by integrating compact triplane neural field and powerful diffusion model. In technique, Blaze3DM begins by optimizing data-dependent triplane embeddings and a shared decoder simultaneously, reconstructing each triplane back to the corresponding 3D volume. To further enhance 3D consistency, we introduce a lightweight 3D aware module to model the correlation of three vertical planes. Then, diffusion model is trained on latent triplane embeddings and achieves both unconditional and conditional triplane generation, which is finally decoded to arbitrary size volume. Extensive experiments on zero-shot 3D medical inverse problem solving, including sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, compressed-sensing MRI, and MRI isotropic super-resolution, demonstrate that Blaze3DM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also markedly improves computational efficiency over existing methods (22~40x faster than previous work).</p></details> |  |
| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v5)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these kinds of domain knowledge separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more in-depth long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. The SSUMamba can exploit complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Zigzag Scan (SSAZS) strategy for HSIs, which helps exploit the continuous information flow in multiple directions of 3-D characteristics within HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparison methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Visual State Space Model for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14343v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. ViTs typically yield superior results in image restoration compared to CNNs due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and input-dependent characteristics. However, the computational complexity of Transformer-based models grows quadratically with the image resolution, limiting their practical appeal in high-resolution image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) to visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on benchmark datasets and real-captured images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image super-resolution algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Traditional enhancement techniques often fail to adequately address issues like noise, color distortion, and detail loss in challenging lighting environments. Our approach leverages insights from the Retinex theory and recent advances in image restoration networks to develop a streamlined model that efficiently processes illumination components and integrates context-sensitive enhancements through optimized convolutional blocks. This results in significantly improved image clarity and color fidelity, while avoiding over-enhancement and unnatural color shifts. Crucially, our model is designed to be lightweight, ensuring low computational demand and suitability for real-time applications on standard consumer hardware. Performance evaluations confirm that our model not only surpasses existing methods in enhancing low-light images but also maintains a minimal computational footprint.</p></details> |  |

To fully utilize the unlabelled data, SAGAN relaxes the cyclic consistency requirement of the existing unpaired image-to-image conversion methods, and generates high-quality health images corresponding to unlabeled data, guided by the reconstruction of normal images and restoration of pseudo-anomaly images.Subsequently, the discrepancy between the generated healthy image and the original image is utilized as an anomaly score.Extensive experiments on three medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accept by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color infection in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a sweet balance of regularization functionals on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color infection reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and manoeuvrability of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,10figures |
| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasizing Crucial Features for Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11468v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a challenging ill-posed problem which estimates latent sharp image from its degraded counterpart. Although the existing methods have achieved promising performance by designing novelty architecture of module, they ignore the fact that different regions in a corrupted image undergo varying degrees of degradation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework to adapt to varying degrees of degradation across different regions for image restoration. Specifically, we design a spatial and frequency attention mechanism (SFAM) to emphasize crucial features for restoration. SFAM consists of two modules: the spatial domain attention module (SDAM) and the frequency domain attention module (FDAM). The SFAM discerns the degradation location through spatial selective attention and channel selective attention in the spatial domain, while the FDAM enhances high-frequency signals to amplify the disparities between sharp and degraded image pairs in the spectral domain. Additionally, to capture global range information, we introduce a multi-scale block (MSBlock) that consists of three scale branches, each containing multiple simplified channel attention blocks (SCABlocks) and a multi-scale feed-forward block (MSFBlock). Finally, we propose our ECFNet, which integrates the aforementioned components into a U-shaped backbone for recovering high-quality images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECFNet, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, in image restoration, the focus is on the mapping relationship from low-quality to high-quality images. Regarding this issue, we introduce the Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge (GOUB) model. By leveraging the natural mean-reverting property of the generalized OU process and further eliminating the variance of its steady-state distribution through the Doob's h-transform, we achieve diffusion mappings from point to point enabling the recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence shared by various bridge models, all of which are special instances of GOUB and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Additionally, we present the corresponding Mean-ODE model adept at capturing both pixel-level details and structural perceptions. Experimental outcomes showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by both models across diverse tasks, including inpainting, deraining, and super-resolution.

However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18.

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

| **[RSDehamba: Lightweight Vision Mamba for Remote Sensing Satellite Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10030v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image dehazing (RSID) aims to remove nonuniform and physically irregular haze factors for high-quality image restoration. The emergence of CNNs and Transformers has taken extraordinary strides in the RSID arena. However, these methods often struggle to demonstrate the balance of adequate long-range dependency modeling and maintaining computational efficiency. To this end, we propose the first lightweight network on the mamba-based model called RSDhamba in the field of RSID. Greatly inspired by the recent rise of Selective State Space Model (SSM) for its superior performance in modeling linear complexity and remote dependencies, our designed RSDehamba integrates the SSM framework into the U-Net architecture. Specifically, we propose the Vision Dehamba Block (VDB) as the core component of the overall network, which utilizes the linear complexity of SSM to achieve the capability of global context encoding. Simultaneously, the Direction-aware Scan Module (DSM) is designed to dynamically aggregate feature exchanges over different directional domains to effectively enhance the flexibility of sensing the spatially varying distribution of haze. In this way, our RSDhamba fully demonstrates the superiority of spatial distance capture dependencies and channel information exchange for better extraction of haze features. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks validate the surpassing performance of our RSDehamba against existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The RAIM challenge constructed a benchmark for image restoration in the wild, including real-world images with/without reference ground truth in various scenarios from real applications. The participants were required to restore the real-captured images from complex and unknown degradation, where generative perceptual quality and fidelity are desired in the restoration result. The challenge consisted of two tasks. Task one employed real referenced data pairs, where quantitative evaluation is available. Task two used unpaired images, and a comprehensive user study was conducted. The challenge attracted more than 200 registrations, where 39 of them submitted results with more than 400 submissions. Top-ranked methods improved the state-of-the-art restoration performance and obtained unanimous recognition from all 18 judges. The proposed datasets are available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DqbxUoiUqkAIkExu3jZAqoElr_nu1IXb/view?usp=sharing and the homepage of this challenge is at https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/17632.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRRffusion: Unveiling Authenticity with Diffusion-Based Face Retouching Reversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07582v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unveiling the real appearance of retouched faces to prevent malicious users from deceptive advertising and economic fraud has been an increasing concern in the era of digital economics. This article makes the first attempt to investigate the face retouching reversal (FRR) problem. We first collect an FRR dataset, named deepFRR, which contains 50,000 StyleGAN-generated high-resolution (1024*1024) facial images and their corresponding retouched ones by a commercial online API. To our best knowledge, deepFRR is the first FRR dataset tailored for training the deep FRR models. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-based FRR approach (FRRffusion) for the FRR task. Our FRRffusion consists of a coarse-to-fine two-stage network: A diffusion-based Facial Morpho-Architectonic Restorer (FMAR) is constructed to generate the basic contours of low-resolution faces in the first stage, while a Transformer-based Hyperrealistic Facial Detail Generator (HFDG) is designed to create high-resolution facial details in the second stage. Tested on deepFRR, our FRRffusion surpasses the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods by a large margin in four widespread quantitative metrics. Especially, the de-retouched images by our FRRffusion are visually much closer to the raw face images than both the retouched face images and those restored by the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods in terms of qualitative evaluation with 85 subjects. These results sufficiently validate the efficacy of our work, bridging the recently-standing gap between the FRR and generic image restoration tasks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/GZHU-DVL/FRRffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Visualization via Low-Dimensional Posterior Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07804v2)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ill-posed inverse problems, it is commonly desirable to obtain insight into the full spectrum of plausible solutions, rather than extracting only a single reconstruction. Information about the plausible solutions and their likelihoods is encoded in the posterior distribution. However, for high-dimensional data, this distribution is challenging to visualize. In this work, we introduce a new approach for estimating and visualizing posteriors by employing energy-based models (EBMs) over low-dimensional subspaces. Specifically, we train a conditional EBM that receives an input measurement and a set of directions that span some low-dimensional subspace of solutions, and outputs the probability density function of the posterior within that space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across a diverse range of datasets and image restoration problems, showcasing its strength in uncertainty quantification and visualization. As we show, our method outperforms a baseline that projects samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, while being orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, it is more accurate than a baseline that assumes a Gaussian posterior.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (RCOT) approach, which models image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for both unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a unique degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we first formalize a Fourier residual-guided OT objective by incorporating the degradation-specific information of the residual into the transport cost. We further design the transport map as a two-pass RCOT map that comprises a base model and a refinement process, in which the transport residual is computed by the base model in the first pass and then encoded as a degradation-specific embedding to condition the second-pass restoration. By duality, the RCOT problem is transformed into a minimax optimization problem, which can be solved by adversarially training neural networks. Extensive experiments on multiple restoration tasks show that RCOT achieves competitive performance in terms of both distortion measures and perceptual quality, restoring images with more faithful structures as compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

However, given the local nature of the convolutional operator, they struggle to capture global information. The promise of attention mechanisms in Transformers is to circumvent this problem, but it comes at the cost of intensive computational overhead. Many recent studies in image restoration have focused on solving the challenge of balancing performance and computational cost via Transformer variants. In this paper, we present CascadedGaze Network (CGNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that employs Global Context Extractor (GCE), a novel and efficient way to capture global information for image restoration. The GCE module leverages small kernels across convolutional layers to learn global dependencies, without requiring self-attention. Extensive experimental results show that our computationally efficient approach performs competitively to a range of state-of-the-art methods on synthetic image denoising and single image deblurring tasks, and pushes the performance boundary further on the real image denoising task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2024. 20 pages</p></details> |

This challenge is to address a major challenge in the field of image and video processing, namely, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) for AI-Generated Content (AIGC). The challenge is divided into the image track and the video track. The image track uses the AIGIQA-20K, which contains 20,000 AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) generated by 15 popular generative models.

A total of 991 submissions are received in the development phase, and 185 submissions are received in the test phase. Finally, 12 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets.

| **[DocRes: A Generalist Model Toward Unifying Document Image Restoration Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04408v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document image restoration is a crucial aspect of Document AI systems, as the quality of document images significantly influences the overall performance. Prevailing methods address distinct restoration tasks independently, leading to intricate systems and the incapability to harness the potential synergies of multi-task learning. To overcome this challenge, we propose DocRes, a generalist model that unifies five document image restoration tasks including dewarping, deshadowing, appearance enhancement, deblurring, and binarization. To instruct DocRes to perform various restoration tasks, we propose a novel visual prompt approach called Dynamic Task-Specific Prompt (DTSPrompt). The DTSPrompt for different tasks comprises distinct prior features, which are additional characteristics extracted from the input image. Beyond its role as a cue for task-specific execution, DTSPrompt can also serve as supplementary information to enhance the model's performance. Moreover, DTSPrompt is more flexible than prior visual prompt approaches as it can be seamlessly applied and adapted to inputs with high and variable resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DocRes achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art task-specific models. This underscores the potential of DocRes across a broader spectrum of document image restoration tasks.

Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalizability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits satisfactory performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms.

| **[Deep Image Restoration For Image Anti-Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02751v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image forensics is concerned with whether an image has been tampered with, image anti-forensics attempts to prevent image forensics methods from detecting tampered images. The competition between these two fields started long before the advancement of deep learning. JPEG compression, blurring and noising, which are simple methods by today's standards, have long been used for anti-forensics and have been the subject of much research in both forensics and anti-forensics. Although these traditional methods are old, they make it difficult to detect fake images and are used for data augmentation in training deep image forgery detection models. In addition to making the image difficult to detect, these methods leave traces on the image and consequently degrade the image quality. Separate image forensics methods have also been developed to detect these traces. In this study, we go one step further and improve the image quality after these methods with deep image restoration models and make it harder to detect the forged image. We evaluate the impact of these methods on image quality. We then test both our proposed methods with deep learning and methods without deep learning on the two best existing image manipulation detection models. In the obtained results, we show how existing image forgery detection models fail against the proposed methods. Code implementation will be publicly available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIRFIAF .</p></details> |  |

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We proceed with the application of an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm for reconstructing the 3D model. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach using both synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Variational Network Toward Blind Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10796v6)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind image restoration (IR) is a common yet challenging problem in computer vision. Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI@2024.

It aims to mitigate compression artifacts caused by unknown quality factors, particularly with JPEG codecs. Existing works on blind CIR often seek assistance from a quality factor prediction network to facilitate their network to restore compressed images. However, the predicted numerical quality factor lacks spatial information, preventing network adaptability toward image contents. Recent studies in prompt-learning-based image restoration have showcased the potential of prompts to generalize across varied degradation types and degrees. This motivated us to design a prompt-learning-based compressed image restoration network, dubbed PromptCIR, which can effectively restore images from various compress levels. Specifically, PromptCIR exploits prompts to encode compression information implicitly, where prompts directly interact with soft weights generated from image features, thus providing dynamic content-aware and distortion-aware guidance for the restoration process. The light-weight prompts enable our method to adapt to different compression levels, while introducing minimal parameter overhead. Overall, PromptCIR leverages the powerful transformer-based backbone with the dynamic prompt module to proficiently handle blind CIR tasks, winning first place in the NTIRE 2024 challenge of blind compressed image enhancement track. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed PromptCIR.

In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in synthesizing high-quality images, previous methods for image restoration and enhancement often overlooked the characteristics of different degradations. They applied the same structure to address various types of degradation, resulting in less-than-ideal restoration outcomes. Inspired by the notion that high/low frequency information is applicable to different degradations, we introduce HLNet, a Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement method based on high-low frequency decomposition. Specifically, we employ two modules for feature extraction: shared weight modules and non-shared weight modules. In the shared weight modules, we use SCConv to extract common features from different degradations. In the non-shared weight modules, we introduce the High-Low Frequency Decomposition Block (HLFDB), which employs different methods to handle high-low frequency information, enabling the model to address different degradations more effectively. Compared to other networks, our method takes into account the characteristics of different degradations, thus achieving higher-quality image restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR 2024 Workshop, code: https://github.com/chengeng0613/HLNet</p></details> |
| **[Face2Face: Label-driven Facial Retouching Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14177v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the popularity of social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, and the widespread availability and convenience of retouching tools, an increasing number of individuals are utilizing these tools to beautify their facial photographs. This poses challenges for fields that place high demands on the authenticity of photographs, such as identity verification and social media. By altering facial images, users can easily create deceptive images, leading to the dissemination of false information. This may pose challenges to the reliability of identity verification systems and social media, and even lead to online fraud. To address this issue, some work has proposed makeup removal methods, but they still lack the ability to restore images involving geometric deformations caused by retouching. To tackle the problem of facial retouching restoration, we propose a framework, dubbed Face2Face, which consists of three components: a facial retouching detector, an image restoration model named FaceR, and a color correction module called Hierarchical Adaptive Instance Normalization (H-AdaIN). Firstly, the facial retouching detector predicts a retouching label containing three integers, indicating the retouching methods and their corresponding degrees. Then FaceR restores the retouched image based on the predicted retouching label. Finally, H-AdaIN is applied to address the issue of color shift arising from diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and each module.</p></details> |  |

To achieve high-quality images, researchers have attempted various image restoration and enhancement operations on photographs, including denoising, deblurring, and high dynamic range imaging. However, merely performing a single type of image enhancement still cannot yield satisfactory images. In this paper, to deal with the challenge above, we propose the Composite Refinement Network (CRNet) to address this issue using multiple exposure images. By fully integrating information-rich multiple exposure inputs, CRNet can perform unified image restoration and enhancement. To improve the quality of image details, CRNet explicitly separates and strengthens high and low-frequency information through pooling layers, using specially designed Multi-Branch Blocks for effective fusion of these frequencies. To increase the receptive field and fully integrate input features, CRNet employs the High-Frequency Enhancement Module, which includes large kernel convolutions and an inverted bottleneck ConvFFN.

Another issue is that most Transformer-based IR methods focus only on either local or global features, leading to limited receptive fields or deficient parameter issues. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight IR network, Reciprocal Attention Mixing Transformer (RAMiT). It employs our proposed dimensional reciprocal attention mixing Transformer (D-RAMiT) blocks, which compute bi-dimensional (spatial and channel) self-attentions in parallel with different numbers of multi-heads. The bi-dimensional attentions help each other to complement their counterpart's drawbacks and are then mixed. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical reciprocal attention mixing (H-RAMi) layer that compensates for pixel-level information losses and utilizes semantic information while maintaining an efficient hierarchical structure. Furthermore, we revisit and modify MobileNet V1 and V2 to attach efficient convolutions to our proposed components. The experimental results demonstrate that RAMiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple lightweight IR tasks, including super-resolution, color denoising, grayscale denoising, low-light enhancement, and deraining.

To overcome these issues, we introduce the Channel-Aware U-Shaped Mamba (CU-Mamba) model, which incorporates a dual State Space Model (SSM) framework into the U-Net architecture. CU-Mamba employs a Spatial SSM module for global context encoding and a Channel SSM component to preserve channel correlation features, both in linear computational complexity relative to the feature map size. Extensive experimental results validate CU-Mamba's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the importance of integrating both spatial and channel contexts in image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaIR: Exploiting Underlying Similarities of Image Restoration Tasks with Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11475v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image restoration approaches typically employ extensive networks specifically trained for designated degradations. Despite being effective, such methods inevitably entail considerable storage costs and computational overheads due to the reliance on task-specific networks. In this work, we go beyond this well-established framework and exploit the inherent commonalities among image restoration tasks. The primary objective is to identify components that are shareable across restoration tasks and augment the shared components with modules specifically trained for individual tasks. Towards this goal, we propose AdaIR, a novel framework that enables low storage cost and efficient training without sacrificing performance. Specifically, a generic restoration network is first constructed through self-supervised pre-training using synthetic degradations. Subsequent to the pre-training phase, adapters are trained to adapt the pre-trained network to specific degradations. AdaIR requires solely the training of lightweight, task-specific modules, ensuring a more efficient storage and training regimen. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of AdaIR and analyze the influence of the pre-training strategy on discovering shareable components. Extensive experimental results show that AdaIR achieves outstanding results on multi-task restoration while utilizing significantly fewer parameters (1.9 MB) and less training time (7 hours) for each restoration task. The source codes and trained models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSSR: Zero-shot Omnidirectional Image Super-Resolution using Stable Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10312v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional images (ODIs) are commonly used in real-world visual tasks, and high-resolution ODIs help improve the performance of related visual tasks. Most existing super-resolution methods for ODIs use end-to-end learning strategies, resulting in inferior realness of generated images and a lack of effective out-of-domain generalization capabilities in training methods. Image generation methods represented by diffusion model provide strong priors for visual tasks and have been proven to be effectively applied to image restoration tasks. Leveraging the image priors of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, we achieve omnidirectional image super-resolution with both fidelity and realness, dubbed as OmniSSR. Firstly, we transform the equirectangular projection (ERP) images into tangent projection (TP) images, whose distribution approximates the planar image domain. Then, we use SD to iteratively sample initial high-resolution results. At each denoising iteration, we further correct and update the initial results using the proposed Octadecaplex Tangent Information Interaction (OTII) and Gradient Decomposition (GD) technique to ensure better consistency. Finally, the TP images are transformed back to obtain the final high-resolution results. Our method is zero-shot, requiring no training or fine-tuning. Experiments of our method on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Bracket Image Restoration and Enhancement with Flow-guided Alignment and Enhanced Feature Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10358v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the Bracket Image Restoration and Enhancement (BracketIRE) task using a novel framework, which requires restoring a high-quality high dynamic range (HDR) image from a sequence of noisy, blurred, and low dynamic range (LDR) multi-exposure RAW inputs. To overcome this challenge, we present the IREANet, which improves the multiple exposure alignment and aggregation with a Flow-guide Feature Alignment Module (FFAM) and an Enhanced Feature Aggregation Module (EFAM). Specifically, the proposed FFAM incorporates the inter-frame optical flow as guidance to facilitate the deformable alignment and spatial attention modules for better feature alignment. The EFAM further employs the proposed Enhanced Residual Block (ERB) as a foundational component, wherein a unidirectional recurrent network aggregates the aligned temporal features to better reconstruct the results. To improve model generalization and performance, we additionally employ the Bayer preserving augmentation (BayerAug) strategy to augment the multi-exposure RAW inputs. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed IREANet shows state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Referring Flexible Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10342v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reality, images often exhibit multiple degradations, such as rain and fog at night (triple degradations). However, in many cases, individuals may not want to remove all degradations, for instance, a blurry lens revealing a beautiful snowy landscape (double degradations). In such scenarios, people may only desire to deblur. These situations and requirements shed light on a new challenge in image restoration, where a model must perceive and remove specific degradation types specified by human commands in images with multiple degradations. We term this task Referring Flexible Image Restoration (RFIR). To address this, we first construct a large-scale synthetic dataset called RFIR, comprising 153,423 samples with the degraded image, text prompt for specific degradation removal and restored image. RFIR consists of five basic degradation types: blur, rain, haze, low light and snow while six main sub-categories are included for varying degrees of degradation removal. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel transformer-based multi-task model named TransRFIR, which simultaneously perceives degradation types in the degraded image and removes specific degradation upon text prompt. TransRFIR is based on two devised attention modules, Multi-Head Agent Self-Attention (MHASA) and Multi-Head Agent Cross Attention (MHACA), where MHASA and MHACA introduce the agent token and reach the linear complexity, achieving lower computation cost than vanilla self-attention and cross-attention and obtaining competitive performances. Our TransRFIR achieves state-of-the-art performances compared with other counterparts and is proven as an effective architecture for image restoration. We release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/FIR-CP.</p></details> | 15 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Equipping Diffusion Models with Differentiable Spatial Entropy for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09735v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration, which aims to recover high-quality images from their corrupted counterparts, often faces the challenge of being an ill-posed problem that allows multiple solutions for a single input. However, most deep learning based works simply employ l1 loss to train their network in a deterministic way, resulting in over-smoothed predictions with inferior perceptual quality. In this work, we propose a novel method that shifts the focus from a deterministic pixel-by-pixel comparison to a statistical perspective, emphasizing the learning of distributions rather than individual pixel values. The core idea is to introduce spatial entropy into the loss function to measure the distribution difference between predictions and targets. To make this spatial entropy differentiable, we employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to approximate the probabilities for specific intensity values of each pixel with their neighbor areas. Specifically, we equip the entropy with diffusion models and aim for superior accuracy and enhanced perceptual quality over l1 based noise matching loss. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed method for low light enhancement on two datasets and the NTIRE challenge 2024. All these results illustrate the effectiveness of our statistic-based entropy loss.

Typically, diffusion models trained in specific datasets fail to recover images that have out-of-distribution degradations. To address this problem, this work leverages a capable vision-language model and a synthetic degradation pipeline to learn image restoration in the wild (wild IR). More specifically, all low-quality images are simulated with a synthetic degradation pipeline that contains multiple common degradations such as blur, resize, noise, and JPEG compression. Then we introduce robust training for a degradation-aware CLIP model to extract enriched image content features to assist high-quality image restoration. Our base diffusion model is the image restoration SDE (IR-SDE). Built upon it, we further present a posterior sampling strategy for fast noise-free image generation. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets. Moreover, experiments on the unified image restoration task illustrate that the proposed posterior sampling improves image generation quality for various degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPRW...</summary><p>CVPRW 2024; Code: https://github.com/Algolzw/daclip-uir</p></details> |
| **[Image Restoration by Denoising Diffusion Models with Iteratively Preconditioned Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16519v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks has become a common approach for addressing image restoration problems. An alternative for training a "task-specific" network for each observation model is to use pretrained deep denoisers for imposing only the signal's prior within iterative algorithms, without additional training. Recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach has become popular with the rise of diffusion/score-based generative models. Using denoisers for general purpose restoration requires guiding the iterations to ensure agreement of the signal with the observations. In low-noise settings, guidance that is based on back-projection (BP) has been shown to be a promising strategy (used recently also under the names "pseudoinverse" or "range/null-space" guidance). However, the presence of noise in the observations hinders the gains from this approach. In this paper, we propose a novel guidance technique, based on preconditioning that allows traversing from BP-based guidance to least squares based guidance along the restoration scheme. The proposed approach is robust to noise while still having much simpler implementation than alternative methods (e.g., it does not require SVD or a large number of iterations). We use it within both an optimization scheme and a sampling-based scheme, and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods for image deblurring and super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (camera-ready).

| **[DiffBIR: Towards Blind Image Restoration with Generative Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15070v3)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DiffBIR, a general restoration pipeline that could handle different blind image restoration tasks in a unified framework. DiffBIR decouples blind image restoration problem into two stages: 1) degradation removal: removing image-independent content; 2) information regeneration: generating the lost image content. Each stage is developed independently but they work seamlessly in a cascaded manner. In the first stage, we use restoration modules to remove degradations and obtain high-fidelity restored results. For the second stage, we propose IRControlNet that leverages the generative ability of latent diffusion models to generate realistic details. Specifically, IRControlNet is trained based on specially produced condition images without distracting noisy content for stable generation performance. Moreover, we design a region-adaptive restoration guidance that can modify the denoising process during inference without model re-training, allowing users to balance realness and fidelity through a tunable guidance scale. Extensive experiments have demonstrated DiffBIR's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches for blind image super-resolution, blind face restoration and blind image denoising tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

| **[TBSN: Transformer-Based Blind-Spot Network for Self-Supervised Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07846v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind-spot networks (BSN) have been prevalent network architectures in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). Existing BSNs are mostly conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers offer potential solutions to the limitations of convolutions and have demonstrated success in various image restoration tasks, their attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thus restricting their applicability in SSID. In this paper, we present a transformer-based blind-spot network (TBSN) by analyzing and redesigning the transformer operators that meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, TBSN follows the architectural principles of dilated BSNs, and incorporates spatial as well as channel self-attention layers to enhance the network capability. For spatial self-attention, an elaborate mask is applied to the attention matrix to restrict its receptive field, thus mimicking the dilated convolution. For channel self-attention, we observe that it may leak the blind-spot information when the channel number is greater than spatial size in the deep layers of multi-scale architectures. To eliminate this effect, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-the-art SSID methods. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/nagejacob/TBSN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Conditional Diffusion Model for Image Restoration with Mixed Degradations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07770v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is rather challenging in adverse weather conditions, especially when multiple degradations occur simultaneously. Blind image decomposition was proposed to tackle this issue, however, its effectiveness heavily relies on the accurate estimation of each component. Although diffusion-based models exhibit strong generative abilities in image restoration tasks, they may generate irrelevant contents when the degraded images are severely corrupted. To address these issues, we leverage physical constraints to guide the whole restoration process, where a mixed degradation model based on atmosphere scattering model is constructed. Then we formulate our Joint Conditional Diffusion Model (JCDM) by incorporating the degraded image and degradation mask to provide precise guidance. To achieve better color and detail recovery results, we further integrate a refinement network to reconstruct the restored image, where Uncertainty Estimation Block (UEB) is employed to enhance the features. Extensive experiments performed on both multi-weather and weather-specific datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art competing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer models have demonstrated excellent performance in image restoration due to their self-attention mechanism, they face limitations in complex scenarios. Leveraging recent advancements in Transformers and various attention mechanisms, our method utilizes customized attention mechanisms to enhance overall performance. DART, our novel network architecture, employs windowed attention to mimic the selective focusing mechanism of human eyes. By dynamically adjusting receptive fields, it optimally captures the fundamental features crucial for image resolution reconstruction. Efficiency and performance balance are achieved through the LongIR attention mechanism for long sequence image restoration. Integration of attention mechanisms across feature and positional dimensions further enhances the recovery of fine details. Evaluation across five restoration tasks consistently positions DART at the forefront. Upon acceptance, we commit to providing publicly accessible code and models to ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in general image restoration using generative models, their performance in human body restoration remains mediocre, often resulting in foreground and background blending, over-smoothing surface textures, missing accessories, and distorted limbs. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel approach by constructing a human body-aware diffusion model that leverages domain-specific knowledge to enhance performance. Specifically, we employ a pretrained body attention module to guide the diffusion model's focus on the foreground, addressing issues caused by blending between the subject and background. We also demonstrate the value of revisiting the language modality of the diffusion model in restoration tasks by seamlessly incorporating text prompt to improve the quality of surface texture and additional clothing and accessories details. Additionally, we introduce a diffusion sampler tailored for fine-grained human body parts, utilizing local semantic information to rectify limb distortions. Lastly, we collect a comprehensive dataset for benchmarking and advancing the field of human body restoration. Extensive experimental validation showcases the superiority of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively, over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models.

The recent segment anything model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting advanced semantic priors to enhance IR tasks. However, the computational cost of SAM is prohibitive for IR, compared to existing smaller IR models. The incorporation of SAM for extracting semantic priors considerably hampers the model inference efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a general framework to distill SAM's semantic knowledge to boost exiting IR models without interfering with their inference process. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of the semantic priors fusion (SPF) scheme and the semantic priors distillation (SPD) scheme. SPF fuses two kinds of information between the restored image predicted by the original IR model and the semantic mask predicted by SAM for the refined restored image. SPD leverages a self-distillation manner to distill the fused semantic priors to boost the performance of original IR models. Additionally, we design a semantic-guided relation (SGR) module for SPD, which ensures semantic feature representation space consistency to fully distill the priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across multiple IR models and tasks, including deraining, deblurring, and denoising.</p></details> |  |

The current state-of-the-art networks are relatively deep and utilize (variants of) self attention mechanisms. Those networks are significantly slower than shallow convolutional networks, which however perform worse. In this paper, we introduce an image restoration network that is both fast and yields excellent image quality. The network is designed to minimize the latency and memory consumption when executed on a standard GPU, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. The network is a simple shallow network with an efficient block that implements global additive multidimensional averaging operations. This block can capture global information and enable a large receptive field even when used in shallow networks with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experiments and evaluations on diverse tasks, we demonstrate that our network achieves comparable or even superior results to existing state-of-the-art image restoration networks with less latency. For instance, we exceed the state-of-the-art result on real-world SIDD denoising by 0.11dB, while being 2 to 10 times faster.</p></details> |  |

However, our analysis indicates that existing transformerbased methods can not establish both exact global and local dependencies simultaneously, which are much critical to restore the details and missing content of degraded images. To this end, we present an efficient image processing transformer architecture with hierarchical attentions, called IPTV2, adopting a focal context self-attention (FCSA) and a global grid self-attention (GGSA) to obtain adequate token interactions in local and global receptive fields. Specifically, FCSA applies the shifted window mechanism into the channel self-attention, helps capture the local context and mutual interaction across channels. And GGSA constructs long-range dependencies in the cross-window grid, aggregates global information in spatial dimension. Moreover, we introduce structural re-parameterization technique to feed-forward network to further improve the model capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed IPT-V2 achieves state-of-the-art results on various image processing tasks, covering denoising, deblurring, deraining and obtains much better trade-off for performance and computational complexity than previous methods. Besides, we extend our method to image generation as latent diffusion backbone, and significantly outperforms DiTs.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to mining spatial relations within images as prompt, which leads to characteristics of different frequencies being neglected and further remaining subtle or undetectable artifacts in the restored image, we develop a Frequency Prompting image restoration method, dubbed FPro, which can effectively provide prompt components from a frequency perspective to guild the restoration model address these differences. Specifically, we first decompose input features into separate frequency parts via dynamically learned filters, where we introduce a gating mechanism for suppressing the less informative elements within the kernels. To propagate useful frequency information as prompt, we then propose a dual prompt block, consisting of a low-frequency prompt modulator (LPM) and a high-frequency prompt modulator (HPM), to handle signals from different bands respectively. Each modulator contains a generation process to incorporate prompting components into the extracted frequency maps, and a modulation part that modifies the prompt feature with the guidance of the decoder features. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the favorable performance of our pipeline against SOTA methods on 5 image restoration tasks, including deraining, deraindrop, demoir\'eing, deblurring, and dehazing.

However, the limitation in capturing local information restricts their capacity to remove degradations. While existing approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by incorporating convolutional operations, the core component in Transformer, i.e., self-attention, which serves as a low-pass filter, could unintentionally dilute or even eliminate the acquired local patterns. In this paper, we propose HIT, a simple yet effective High-frequency Injected Transformer for image restoration. Specifically, we design a window-wise injection module (WIM), which incorporates abundant high-frequency details into the feature map, to provide reliable references for restoring high-quality images. We also develop a bidirectional interaction module (BIM) to aggregate features at different scales using a mutually reinforced paradigm, resulting in spatially and contextually improved representations. In addition, we introduce a spatial enhancement unit (SEU) to preserve essential spatial relationships that may be lost due to the computations carried out across channel dimensions in the BIM. Extensive experiments on 9 tasks (real noise, real rain streak, raindrop, motion blur, moir\'e, shadow, snow, haze, and low-light condition) demonstrate that HIT with linear computational complexity performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Deep Equilibrium Diffusion Restoration with Parallel Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11600v2)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion model-based image restoration (IR) aims to use diffusion models to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images, achieving promising performance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models, most existing methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step, resulting in expensive sampling time and high computation costs. Moreover, such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship between inputs and restoration results since it is hard to compute the gradients in the whole chains. In this work, we aim to rethink the diffusion model-based IR models through a different perspective, i.e., a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system, called DeqIR. Specifically, we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in these IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. Based on the analytical solution, we can conduct parallel sampling and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore, we compute fast gradients via DEQ inversion and found that initialization optimization can boost image quality and control the generation direction. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on typical IR tasks and real-world settings.</p></details> | CVPR'2024 |
| **[Towards Image Ambient Lighting Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18730v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lighting normalization is a crucial but underexplored restoration task with broad applications. However, existing works often simplify this task within the context of shadow removal, limiting the light sources to one and oversimplifying the scene, thus excluding complex self-shadows and restricting surface classes to smooth ones. Although promising, such simplifications hinder generalizability to more realistic settings encountered in daily use. In this paper, we propose a new challenging task termed Ambient Lighting Normalization (ALN), which enables the study of interactions between shadows, unifying image restoration and shadow removal in a broader context. To address the lack of appropriate datasets for ALN, we introduce the large-scale high-resolution dataset Ambient6K, comprising samples obtained from multiple light sources and including self-shadows resulting from complex geometries, which is the first of its kind. For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously evaluate them on Ambient6K. Additionally, we propose IFBlend, a novel strong baseline that maximizes Image-Frequency joint entropy to selectively restore local areas under different lighting conditions, without relying on shadow localization priors.

Researchers have attempted to generate synthesized training data using paired or unpaired samples to address this challenge. This study proposes SeNM-VAE, a semi-supervised noise modeling method that leverages both paired and unpaired datasets to generate realistic degraded data. Our approach is based on modeling the conditional distribution of degraded and clean images with a specially designed graphical model. Under the variational inference framework, we develop an objective function for handling both paired and unpaired data. We employ our method to generate paired training samples for real-world image denoising and super-resolution tasks. Our approach excels in the quality of synthetic degraded images compared to other unpaired and paired noise modeling methods. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates remarkable performance in downstream image restoration tasks, even with limited paired data. With more paired data, our method achieves the best performance on the SIDD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Rectifying Diffusion Sampling with Perturbed-Attention Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17377v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality samples, but their quality heavily depends on sampling guidance techniques, such as classifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free guidance (CFG). These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG significantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks where existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including ControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and deblurring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://ku-cvlab.github.io/Perturbed-Attention-Guidance</p></details> |
| **[MambaIR: A Simple Baseline for Image Restoration with State-Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15648v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen significant advancements in image restoration, largely attributed to the development of modern deep neural networks, such as CNNs and Transformers. However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/csguoh/MambaIR}.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17744v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can act as a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). In recent years, DIP has been utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually utilize a single pyramid-shaped CNN architecture to parameterize the generator, which cannot effectively exploit the spatio-temporal correlations within the dynamic data. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to exploit the DIP prior for dynamic MRI reconstruction, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). The generative model is decomposed into two stages: image recovery and manifold discovery, which is bridged by a graph convolutional network to exploit the spatio-temporal correlations. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to further improve the reconstruction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and unsupervised methods over different sampling trajectories, and significantly reduces the performance gap with the state-of-art supervised deep-learning methods. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual Denoising Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13712v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose residual denoising diffusion models (RDDM), a novel dual diffusion process that decouples the traditional single denoising diffusion process into residual diffusion and noise diffusion. This dual diffusion framework expands the denoising-based diffusion models, initially uninterpretable for image restoration, into a unified and interpretable model for both image generation and restoration by introducing residuals. Specifically, our residual diffusion represents directional diffusion from the target image to the degraded input image and explicitly guides the reverse generation process for image restoration, while noise diffusion represents random perturbations in the diffusion process. The residual prioritizes certainty, while the noise emphasizes diversity, enabling RDDM to effectively unify tasks with varying certainty or diversity requirements, such as image generation and restoration. We demonstrate that our sampling process is consistent with that of DDPM and DDIM through coefficient transformation, and propose a partially path-independent generation process to better understand the reverse process. Notably, our RDDM enables a generic UNet, trained with only an L1 loss and a batch size of 1, to compete with state-of-the-art image restoration methods. We provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration, application, and development of our innovative framework (https://github.com/nachifur/RDDM).</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |
| **[Latent Neural Cellular Automata for Resource-Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15525v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural cellular automata represent an evolution of the traditional cellular automata model, enhanced by the integration of a deep learning-based transition function. This shift from a manual to a data-driven approach significantly increases the adaptability of these models, enabling their application in diverse domains, including content generation and artificial life. However, their widespread application has been hampered by significant computational requirements. In this work, we introduce the Latent Neural Cellular Automata (LNCA) model, a novel architecture designed to address the resource limitations of neural cellular automata. Our approach shifts the computation from the conventional input space to a specially designed latent space, relying on a pre-trained autoencoder. We apply our model in the context of image restoration, which aims to reconstruct high-quality images from their degraded versions. This modification not only reduces the model's resource consumption but also maintains a flexible framework suitable for various applications. Our model achieves a significant reduction in computational requirements while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. This increase in efficiency allows for inputs up to 16 times larger than current state-of-the-art neural cellular automata models, using the same resources.</p></details> |  |

High-resolution satellite images are very important for land crop monitoring, urban planning, wildfire management and a variety of applications. It is a significant yet challenging task to achieve high spatial-temporal resolution in satellite imaging. With the advent of diffusion models, we can now learn strong generative priors to generate realistic satellite images with high resolution, which can be utilized to promote the super-resolution task as well. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based fusion algorithm called \textbf{SatDiffMoE} that can take an arbitrary number of sequential low-resolution satellite images at the same location as inputs, and fuse them into one high-resolution reconstructed image with more fine details, by leveraging and fusing the complementary information from different time points. Our algorithm is highly flexible and allows training and inference on arbitrary number of low-resolution images. Experimental results show that our proposed SatDiffMoE method not only achieves superior performance for the satellite image super-resolution tasks on a variety of datasets, but also gets an improved computational efficiency with reduced model parameters, compared with previous methods.</p></details> |  |

Due to the demanding memory, time, and data requirements, it is difficult to train a diffusion model directly on the entire volume of high-dimensional data to obtain an efficient 3D diffusion prior. Existing works utilizing diffusion priors on single 2D image slice with hand-crafted cross-slice regularization would sacrifice the z-axis consistency, which results in severe artifacts along the z-axis. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enables learning the 3D image prior through position-aware 3D-patch diffusion score blending for reconstructing large-scale 3D medical images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a 3D-patch diffusion prior for 3D medical image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on sparse view and limited angle CT reconstruction show that our DiffusionBlend method significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world CT reconstruction problems with high-dimensional 3D image (i.e., $256 \times 256 \times 500$). Our algorithm also comes with better or comparable computational efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This is important for various applications from technical documents, to children's books to illustrating cooking recipes. Generating object-correct counts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep a sense of separate identity for every instance of the object, even if several objects look identical or overlap, and then carry out a global computation implicitly during generation. It is still unknown if such representations exist. To address count-correct generation, we first identify features within the diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. We then use them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process and detect over-generation and under-generation. We fix the latter by training a model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object, based on the layout of existing ones, and show how it can be used to guide denoising with correct object count. Our approach, CountGen, does not depend on external source to determine object layout, but rather uses the prior from the diffusion model itself, creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, we find that CountGen strongly outperforms the count-accuracy of existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is at https://make-it-count-paper.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Crafting Parts for Expressive Object Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10197v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation from large generative models like Stable Diffusion, DALLE-2, etc., have become a common base for various tasks due to their superior quality and extensive knowledge bases. As image composition and generation are creative processes the artists need control over various parts of the images being generated. We find that just adding details about parts in the base text prompt either leads to an entirely different image (e.g., missing/incorrect identity) or the extra part details simply being ignored. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartCraft, which enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level details specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartCraft first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right object region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each of the part regions based on fine-grained part descriptions and combine them to produce the final image. All the stages of PartCraft are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across various domains without training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartCraft qualitatively through visual examples and quantitatively in comparison to the contemporary baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page Will Be Here: https://rangwani-harsh.github.io/PartCraft</p></details> |

Its simpleness shows in three aspects: (1) It can be trained on the speech-only dataset, without any alignment information; (2) It directly takes plain text as input and generates speech through an NAR way; (3) It tries to model speech in a finite and compact latent space, which alleviates the modeling difficulty of diffusion. More specifically, we propose a novel speech codec model (SQ-Codec) with scalar quantization, SQ-Codec effectively maps the complex speech signal into a finite and compact latent space, named scalar latent space. Benefits from SQ-Codec, we apply a novel transformer diffusion model in the scalar latent space of SQ-Codec. We train SimpleSpeech on 4k hours of a speech-only dataset, it shows natural prosody and voice cloning ability.

However, due to the iterative nature of the diffusion process and its reliance on classifier-free guidance, inference times are slow. In this paper, we propose a new distillation approach for guided diffusion models in which an external lightweight guide model is trained while the original text-to-image model remains frozen. We show that our method reduces the inference computation of classifier-free guided latent-space diffusion models by almost half, and only requires 1\% trainable parameters of the base model. Furthermore, once trained, our guide model can be applied to various fine-tuned, domain-specific versions of the base diffusion model without the need for additional training: this "plug-and-play" functionality drastically improves inference computation while maintaining the visual fidelity of generated images. Empirically, we show that our approach is able to produce visually appealing results and achieve a comparable FID score to the teacher with as few as 8 to 16 steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2024 project page: https://5410tiffany.github.io/plug-and-play-diffusion-distillation.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Training-free Camera Control for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10126v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free and robust solution to offer camera movement control for off-the-shelf video diffusion models. Unlike previous work, our method does not require any supervised finetuning on camera-annotated datasets or self-supervised training via data augmentation. Instead, it can be plugged and played with most pretrained video diffusion models and generate camera controllable videos with a single image or text prompt as input. The inspiration of our work comes from the layout prior that intermediate latents hold towards generated results, thus rearranging noisy pixels in them will make output content reallocated as well. As camera move could also be seen as a kind of pixel rearrangement caused by perspective change, videos could be reorganized following specific camera motion if their noisy latents change accordingly. Established on this, we propose our method CamTrol, which enables robust camera control for video diffusion models. It is achieved by a two-stage process. First, we model image layout rearrangement through explicit camera movement in 3D point cloud space. Second, we generate videos with camera motion using layout prior of noisy latents formed by a series of rearranged images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the robustness our method holds in controlling camera motion of generated videos. Furthermore, we show that our method can produce impressive results in generating 3D rotation videos with dynamic content. Project page at https://lifedecoder.github.io/CamTrol/.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread use has also brought forth new challenges in model security, which motivates the creation of more effective adversarial attackers on DMs to understand its vulnerability. We propose CAAT, a simple but generic and efficient approach that does not require costly training to effectively fool latent diffusion models (LDMs). The approach is based on the observation that cross-attention layers exhibits higher sensitivity to gradient change, allowing for leveraging subtle perturbations on published images to significantly corrupt the generated images. We show that a subtle perturbation on an image can significantly impact the cross-attention layers, thus changing the mapping between text and image during the fine-tuning of customized diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAAT is compatible with diverse diffusion models and outperforms baseline attack methods in a more effective (more noise) and efficient (twice as fast as Anti-DreamBooth and Mist) manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2024, code:https://github.com/CO2-cityao/CAAT</p></details> |

Recently, an orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm was introduced that uses orthogonal matrices for adapting the weights of a pretrained model. In this paper, we introduce a new class of structured matrices, which unifies and generalizes structured classes from previous works. We examine properties of this class and build a structured orthogonal parametrization upon it. We then use this parametrization to modify the orthogonal fine-tuning framework, improving parameter and computational efficiency. We empirically validate our method on different domains, including adapting of text-to-image diffusion models and downstream task fine-tuning in language modeling. Additionally, we adapt our construction for orthogonal convolutions and conduct experiments with 1-Lipschitz neural networks.</p></details> |  |

This process is achieved through the distillation of pretrained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, Dreamfusion encounters fidelity and efficiency constraints: it faces the multi-head Janus issue and exhibits a relatively slow optimization process. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OrientDream, a camera orientation conditioned framework designed for efficient and multi-view consistent 3D generation from textual prompts. Our strategy emphasizes the implementation of an explicit camera orientation conditioned feature in the pre-training of a 2D text-to-image diffusion module. This feature effectively utilizes data from MVImgNet, an extensive external multi-view dataset, to refine and bolster its functionality. Subsequently, we utilize the pre-conditioned 2D images as a basis for optimizing a randomly initialized implicit representation (NeRF). This process is significantly expedited by a decoupled back-propagation technique, allowing for multiple updates of implicit parameters per optimization cycle. Our experiments reveal that our method not only produces high-quality NeRF models with consistent multi-view properties but also achieves an optimization speed significantly greater than existing methods, as quantified by comparative metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are limited by the quality of the dataset and cannot accurately localize editing regions in images with complex object relationships. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning Guided Image Editing Method(InstructRL4Pix) to train a diffusion model to generate images that are guided by the attention maps of the target object. Our method maximizes the output of the reward model by calculating the distance between attention maps as a reward function and fine-tuning the diffusion model using proximal policy optimization (PPO). We evaluate our model in object insertion, removal, replacement, and transformation. Experimental results show that InstructRL4Pix breaks through the limitations of traditional datasets and uses unsupervised learning to optimize editing goals and achieve accurate image editing based on natural human commands.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, the images may be blurry or noisy due to the influence of weather conditions and inherent limitations of the camera. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a robust depth estimation model. Benefiting from the training strategies of generative networks, generative-based methods often exhibit enhanced robustness. In light of this, we employ a well-converging diffusion model among generative networks for unsupervised monocular depth estimation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical feature-guided denoising module. This model significantly enriches the model's capacity for learning and interpreting depth distribution by fully leveraging image features to guide the denoising process. Furthermore, we explore the implicit depth within reprojection and design an implicit depth consistency loss. This loss function serves to enhance the performance of the model and ensure the scale consistency of depth within a video sequence. We conduct experiments on the KITTI, Make3D, and our self-collected SIMIT datasets. The results indicate that our approach stands out among generative-based models, while also showcasing remarkable robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Conditioned Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09768v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently been shown to excel in many image reconstruction tasks that involve inverse problems based on a forward measurement operator. A common framework uses task-agnostic unconditional models that are later post-conditioned for reconstruction, an approach that typically suffers from suboptimal task performance. While task-specific conditional models have also been proposed, current methods heuristically inject measured data as a naive input channel that elicits sampling inaccuracies. Here, we address the optimal conditioning of diffusion models for solving challenging inverse problems that arise during image reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a novel Bayesian conditioning technique for diffusion models, BCDM, based on score-functions associated with the conditional distribution of desired images given measured data. We rigorously derive the theory to express and train the conditional score-function. Finally, we show state-of-the-art performance in image dealiasing, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting with the proposed technique.</p></details> | 17 pages |

In this paper, we introduce a zero-shot, open-vocabulary diffusion policy method for robot manipulation. Using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), our method transforms linguistic task descriptions into actionable keyframes in 3D space. These keyframes serve to guide the diffusion process via inpainting. However, naively enforcing the diffusion process to adhere to the generated keyframes is problematic: the keyframes from the VLMs may be incorrect and lead to out-of-distribution (OOD) action sequences where the diffusion model performs poorly. To address these challenges, we develop an inpainting optimization strategy that balances adherence to the keyframes v.s. the training data distribution. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of traditional fine-tuned language-conditioned methods in both simulated and real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as expensive computational cost, high inference latency, and difficulties of integration with large language models (LLMs) have necessitated exploring alternatives to DMs. This paper introduces ControlVAR, a novel framework that explores pixel-level controls in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling for flexible and efficient conditional generation. In contrast to traditional conditional models that learn the conditional distribution, ControlVAR jointly models the distribution of image and pixel-level conditions during training and imposes conditional controls during testing. To enhance the joint modeling, we adopt the next-scale AR prediction paradigm and unify control and image representations. A teacher-forcing guidance strategy is proposed to further facilitate controllable generation with joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy and flexibility of ControlVAR across various conditional generation tasks against popular conditional DMs, \eg, ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 19 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Based on these properties, our method enables the generation of 3D deformable objects with diversity in both identities and poses, using variations of a single object. It does not require explicit shape parameterization such as skeletons or joints, point-level or shape-level correspondence supervision, or variations of the target object for pose transfer. To achieve pose disentanglement, compactness for generative models, and transferability, we first design the pose extractor to represent the pose as a keypoint-based hybrid representation and the pose applier to learn an implicit deformation field. To better distill pose information from the object's geometry, we propose the implicit pose applier to output an intrinsic mesh property, the face Jacobian. Once the extracted pose information is transferred to the target object, the pose applier is fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to better describe the target object's shapes with pose variations. The extracted poses are also used to train a cascaded diffusion model to enable the generation of novel poses. Our experiments with the DeformThings4D and Human datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose transfer and the ability to generate diverse deformed shapes with various objects and poses.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> |  |

However, they have also raised significant societal concerns, such as the generation of harmful content and copyright disputes. Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising solution, capable of removing undesired generative capabilities from DMs. However, existing MU evaluation systems present several key challenges that can result in incomplete and inaccurate assessments. To address these issues, we propose UnlearnCanvas, a comprehensive high-resolution stylized image dataset that facilitates the evaluation of the unlearning of artistic styles and associated objects. This dataset enables the establishment of a standardized, automated evaluation framework with 7 quantitative metrics assessing various aspects of the unlearning performance for DMs. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 9 state-of-the-art MU methods for DMs, revealing novel insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we explore challenging unlearning scenarios for DMs to evaluate worst-case performance against adversarial prompts, the unlearning of finer-scale concepts, and sequential unlearning. We hope that this study can pave the way for developing more effective, accurate, and robust DM unlearning methods, ensuring safer and more ethical applications of DMs in the future. The dataset, benchmark, and codes are publicly available at https://unlearn-canvas.netlify.app/.</p></details> |  |

While these models have demonstrated exceptional performance in generating novel and plausible data, it remains an open question whether they can effectively accelerate scientific discovery through the data generation and drive significant advancements across various scientific fields. In particular, the discovery of new inorganic materials with promising properties poses a critical challenge, both scientifically and for industrial applications. However, unlike textual or image data, materials, or more specifically crystal structures, consist of multiple types of variables - including lattice vectors, atom positions, and atomic species. This complexity in data give rise to a variety of approaches for representing and generating such data. Consequently, the design choices of generative models for crystal structures remain an open question. In this study, we explore a new type of diffusion model for the generative inverse design of crystal structures, with a backbone based on a Transformer architecture. We demonstrate our models are superior to previous methods in their versatility for generating crystal structures with desired properties. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that the optimal conditioning methods vary depending on the dataset.</p></details> |  |

Backdoor Attacks on Security-Enhancing Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09669v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to their remarkable denoising capabilities, diffusion models are increasingly being employed as defensive tools to reinforce the security of other models, notably in purifying adversarial examples and certifying adversarial robustness. However, the security risks of these practices themselves remain largely unexplored, which is highly concerning. To bridge this gap, this work investigates the vulnerabilities of security-enhancing diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that these models are highly susceptible to DIFF2, a simple yet effective backdoor attack, which substantially diminishes the security assurance provided by such models. Essentially, DIFF2 achieves this by integrating a malicious diffusion-sampling process into the diffusion model, guiding inputs embedded with specific triggers toward an adversary-defined distribution while preserving the normal functionality for clean inputs. Our case studies on adversarial purification and robustness certification show that DIFF2 can significantly reduce both post-purification and certified accuracy across benchmark datasets and models, highlighting the potential risks of relying on pre-trained diffusion models as defensive tools. We further explore possible countermeasures, suggesting promising avenues for future research.</p></details> |  |

Recent works to combat Deepfakes videos have developed detectors that are highly accurate at identifying GAN-generated samples. However, the robustness of these detectors on diffusion-generated videos generated from video creation tools (e.g., SORA by OpenAI, Runway Gen-2, and Pika, etc.) is still unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting videos synthesized from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models, such as Stable Video Diffusion. We find that the SOTA methods for detecting diffusion-generated images lack robustness in identifying diffusion-generated videos. Our analysis reveals that the effectiveness of these detectors diminishes when applied to out-of-domain videos, primarily because they struggle to track the temporal features and dynamic variations between frames. To address the above-mentioned challenge, we collect a new benchmark video dataset for diffusion-generated videos using SOTA video creation tools. We extract representation within explicit knowledge from the diffusion model for video frames and train our detector with a CNN + LSTM architecture. The evaluation shows that our framework can well capture the temporal features between frames, achieves 93.7% detection accuracy for in-domain videos, and improves the accuracy of out-domain videos by up to 16 points.</p></details> |  |

In response, we present DreamWire, an AI system enabling everyone to craft MVWA easily. Users express their vision through text prompts or scribbles, freeing them from intricate 3D wire organisation. Our approach synergises 3D B\'ezier curves, Prim's algorithm, and knowledge distillation from diffusion models or their variants (e.g., ControlNet). This blend enables the system to represent 3D wire art, ensuring spatial continuity and overcoming data scarcity. Extensive evaluation and analysis are conducted to shed insight on the inner workings of the proposed system, including the trade-off between connectivity and visual aesthetics.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[Improving Consistency Models with Generator-Induced Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09570v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models are promising generative models as they distill the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. Without access to sampling trajectories of a pre-trained diffusion model, consistency training relies on proxy trajectories built on an independent coupling between the noise and data distributions. Refining this coupling is a key area of improvement to make it more adapted to the task and reduce the resulting randomness in the training process. In this work, we introduce a novel coupling associating the input noisy data with their generated output from the consistency model itself, as a proxy to the inaccessible diffusion flow output. Our affordable approach exploits the inherent capacity of consistency models to compute the transport map in a single step. We provide intuition and empirical evidence of the relevance of our generator-induced coupling (GC), which brings consistency training closer to score distillation. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence by significant amounts but also enhances the resulting performance.

Such formulations are applicable when there are separate sets of optimization criteria and constraints on a system's behavior. We approach this problem by first establishing a policy difference lemma for the episodic setting, which provides the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. Then, we propose to combine a set of established and novel solution ideas to yield the $\texttt{e-COP}$ algorithm that is easy to implement and numerically stable, and provide a theoretical guarantee on optimality under certain scaling assumptions. Through extensive empirical analysis using benchmarks in the Safety Gym suite, we show that our algorithm has similar or better performance than SoTA (non-episodic) algorithms adapted for the episodic setting. The scalability of the algorithm opens the door to its application in safety-constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language or Diffusion Models.</p></details> |  |

But reliable measurement is fundamentally challenging, and touches on issues of reproducibility, scalability, uncertainty quantification, epistemology, and more. This dissertation addresses criteria needed to take reliability seriously: both criteria for designing meaningful metrics, and for methodologies that ensure that we can dependably and efficiently measure these metrics at scale and in practice. In doing so, this dissertation articulates a research vision for a new field of scholarship at the intersection of machine learning, law, and policy. Within this frame, we cover topics that fit under three different themes: (1) quantifying and mitigating sources of arbitrariness in ML, (2) taming randomness in uncertainty estimation and optimization algorithms, in order to achieve scalability without sacrificing reliability, and (3) providing methods for evaluating generative-AI systems, with specific focuses on quantifying memorization in language models and training latent diffusion models on open-licensed data. By making contributions in these three themes, this dissertation serves as an empirical proof by example that research on reliable measurement for machine learning is intimately and inescapably bound up with research in law and policy. These different disciplines pose similar research questions about reliable measurement in machine learning. They are, in fact, two complementary sides of the same research vision, which, broadly construed, aims to construct machine-learning systems that cohere with broader societal values.</p></details> | Ph.D. Dissertation |

Our approach interprets diffusion distillation as a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of the diffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, we propose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusion model's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, we adapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a text alignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation. E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillation methods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate that our one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillation models -- DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning -- on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mingukkang.github.io/Diffusion2GAN/</p></details> |

However, training such models usually requires large amounts of clean signals which are often difficult or impossible to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel training technique for generative diffusion models based only on corrupted data. We introduce a loss function based on the Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE), and prove that under some conditions, it is equivalent to the training objective used in fully supervised diffusion models. We demonstrate our technique on face images as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the use of undersampled data significantly alleviates data collection costs. Our approach achieves generative performance comparable to its fully supervised counterpart without training on any clean signals. In addition, we deploy the resulting diffusion model in various downstream tasks beyond the degradation present in the training set, showcasing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/bahjat-kawar/gsure-diffusion</p></details> |

To demonstrate the reliability and flexibility of CleanDiffuser, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various DM algorithms implemented with CleanDiffuser across an extensive range of tasks. The analytical experiments provide a wealth of valuable design choices and insights, reveal opportunities and challenges, and lay a solid groundwork for future research.

Instead, we present an interesting finding that questions the necessity of the inductive bias -- locality in modern computer vision architectures. Concretely, we find that vanilla Transformers can operate by directly treating each individual pixel as a token and achieve highly performant results. This is substantially different from the popular design in Vision Transformer, which maintains the inductive bias from ConvNets towards local neighborhoods (e.g. by treating each 16x16 patch as a token). We mainly showcase the effectiveness of pixels-as-tokens across three well-studied tasks in computer vision: supervised learning for object classification, self-supervised learning via masked autoencoding, and image generation with diffusion models. Although directly operating on individual pixels is less computationally practical, we believe the community must be aware of this surprising piece of knowledge when devising the next generation of neural architectures for computer vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, 23 pages</p></details> |
| **[Alleviating Distortion in Image Generation via Multi-Resolution Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09416v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents innovative enhancements to diffusion models by integrating a novel multi-resolution network and time-dependent layer normalization. Diffusion models have gained prominence for their effectiveness in high-fidelity image generation. While conventional approaches rely on convolutional U-Net architectures, recent Transformer-based designs have demonstrated superior performance and scalability. However, Transformer architectures, which tokenize input data (via "patchification"), face a trade-off between visual fidelity and computational complexity due to the quadratic nature of self-attention operations concerning token length. While larger patch sizes enable attention computation efficiency, they struggle to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to image distortions. To address this challenge, we propose augmenting the Diffusion model with the Multi-Resolution network (DiMR), a framework that refines features across multiple resolutions, progressively enhancing detail from low to high resolution. Additionally, we introduce Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), a parameter-efficient approach that incorporates time-dependent parameters into layer normalization to inject time information and achieve superior performance. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, where DiMR-XL variants outperform prior diffusion models, setting new state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.70 on ImageNet 256 x 256 and 2.89 on ImageNet 512 x 512.

We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 models, each of which is a base model fine-tuned to insert a different person's visual identity. We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, as each point in the space corresponds to an identity, sampling a set of weights from it results in a model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard). These edits persist in appearance across generated samples. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space reconstructs a realistic identity, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models behaves as an interpretable latent space of identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/weights2weights</p></details> |

To overcome the fundamental limitation of missing 3D consistency in 2D diffusion models, our key insight is to introduce three synergetic strategies that augment the input of the 2D diffusion model to become 3D-aware and to explicitly enforce 3D consistency during the training process. Specifically, we design surrounding views as context-rich input for the 2D diffusion model, and generate 3D-consistent, structured noise instead of image-independent noise. Moreover, we introduce self-supervised consistency-enforcing training within the per-scene editing procedure. Extensive evaluation shows that our ConsistDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance for instruction-guided scene editing across various scenes and editing instructions, particularly in complicated large-scale indoor scenes from ScanNet++, with significantly improved sharpness and fine-grained textures. Notably, ConsistDreamer stands as the first work capable of successfully editing complex (e.g., plaid/checkered) patterns.

Traditional applications of 2D diffusion models in dynamic scene editing often result in inconsistency, primarily due to their inherent frame-by-frame editing methodology. Addressing the complexities of extending instruction-guided editing to 4D, our key insight is to treat a 4D scene as a pseudo-3D scene, decoupled into two sub-problems: achieving temporal consistency in video editing and applying these edits to the pseudo-3D scene. Following this, we first enhance the Instruct-Pix2Pix (IP2P) model with an anchor-aware attention module for batch processing and consistent editing. Additionally, we integrate optical flow-guided appearance propagation in a sliding window fashion for more precise frame-to-frame editing and incorporate depth-based projection to manage the extensive data of pseudo-3D scenes, followed by iterative editing to achieve convergence. We extensively evaluate our approach in various scenes and editing instructions, and demonstrate that it achieves spatially and temporally consistent editing results, with significantly enhanced detail and sharpness over the prior art. Notably, Instruct 4D-to-4D is general and applicable to both monocular and challenging multi-camera scenes.

Based on the finding that existing tokenizers are tailored to image or video inputs, this paper presents OmniTokenizer, a transformer-based tokenizer for joint image and video tokenization. OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by 13% and 26%, respectively. Additionally, we also show that when integrated with OmniTokenizer, both language model-based approaches and diffusion models can realize advanced visual synthesis performance, underscoring the superiority and versatility of our method.

Prior works use diffusion models to generate driving images conditioned on the 3D object layout. However, those models are trained on small-scale datasets like nuScenes, which lack appearance and layout diversity. Moreover, the trained models can only generate images based on the real-world layout data from the validation set of the same dataset, where overfitting might happen. In this work, we introduce a simulator-conditioned scene generation framework called SimGen that can learn to generate diverse driving scenes by mixing data from the simulator and the real world. It uses a novel cascade diffusion pipeline to address challenging sim-to-real gaps and multi-condition conflicts. A driving video dataset DIVA is collected to enhance the generative diversity of SimGen, which contains over 147.5 hours of real-world driving videos from 73 locations worldwide and simulated driving data from the MetaDrive simulator. SimGen achieves superior generation quality and diversity while preserving controllability based on the text prompt and the layout pulled from a simulator. We further demonstrate the improvements brought by SimGen for synthetic data augmentation on the BEV detection and segmentation task and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation.

| **[Score Distillation via Reparametrized DDIM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15891v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 2D diffusion models generate realistic, high-detail images, 3D shape generation methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) built on these 2D diffusion models produce cartoon-like, over-smoothed shapes. To help explain this discrepancy, we show that the image guidance used in Score Distillation can be understood as the velocity field of a 2D denoising generative process, up to the choice of a noise term. In particular, after a change of variables, SDS resembles a high-variance version of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) with a differently-sampled noise term: SDS introduces noise i.i.d. randomly at each step, while DDIM infers it from the previous noise predictions. This excessive variance can lead to over-smoothing and unrealistic outputs. We show that a better noise approximation can be recovered by inverting DDIM in each SDS update step. This modification makes SDS's generative process for 2D images almost identical to DDIM. In 3D, it removes over-smoothing, preserves higher-frequency detail, and brings the generation quality closer to that of 2D samplers. Experimentally, our method achieves better or similar 3D generation quality compared to other state-of-the-art Score Distillation methods, all without training additional neural networks or multi-view supervision, and providing useful insights into relationship between 2D and 3D asset generation with diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 25 pages, 26 figures.

Traditional GAN-based methods have achieved notable success, but recent advancements in diffusion models have produced superior results due to their training on large-scale datasets, enabling the generation of remarkably realistic inpainted images. Despite their strengths, diffusion models often struggle with object removal tasks without explicit guidance, leading to unintended hallucinations of the removed object. To address this issue, we introduce CLIPAway, a novel approach leveraging CLIP embeddings to focus on background regions while excluding foreground elements. CLIPAway enhances inpainting accuracy and quality by identifying embeddings that prioritize the background, thus achieving seamless object removal. Unlike other methods that rely on specialized training datasets or costly manual annotations, CLIPAway provides a flexible, plug-and-play solution compatible with various diffusion-based inpainting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yigitekin.github.io/CLIPAway/</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Hallucinations in Diffusion Models through Mode Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09358v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colloquially speaking, image generation models based upon diffusion processes are frequently said to exhibit "hallucinations," samples that could never occur in the training data. But where do such hallucinations come from? In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term mode interpolation. Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly "interpolate" between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations). We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations. Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed. Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact know when they go out of support and hallucinate. This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process. Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95% of hallucinations at generation time while retaining 96% of in-support samples. We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on MNIST and 2D Gaussians dataset. We release our code at https://github.com/locuslab/diffusion-model-hallucination.</p></details> |  |

This new generation of diffusion-based graph generative models has demonstrated significant performance improvements over methods that rely on variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks. It's important to recognize, however, that most of these models employ Gaussian or categorical diffusion processes, which can struggle with sparse and long-tailed data distributions. In our work, we introduce Graph Beta Diffusion (GBD), a diffusion-based generative model particularly adept at capturing diverse graph structures. GBD utilizes a beta diffusion process, tailored for the sparse and range-bounded characteristics of graph adjacency matrices. Furthermore, we have developed a modulation technique that enhances the realism of the generated graphs by stabilizing the generation of critical graph structures, while preserving flexibility elsewhere. The outstanding performance of GBD across three general graph benchmarks and two biochemical graph benchmarks highlights its capability to effectively capture the complexities of real-world graph data.

In this paper, we aim not to address this issue by directly introducing fair learning algorithms, but rather by generating entirely new, fair synthetic data from biased datasets for use in any downstream tasks. Additionally, the distribution of test data may differ from that of the training set, potentially impacting the performance of the generated synthetic data in downstream tasks. To address these two challenges, we propose a diffusion model-based framework, FADM: Fairness-Aware Diffusion with Meta-training. FADM introduces two types of gradient induction during the sampling phase of the diffusion model: one to ensure that the generated samples belong to the desired target categories, and another to make the sensitive attributes of the generated samples difficult to classify into any specific sensitive attribute category. To overcome data distribution shifts in the test environment, we train the diffusion model and the two classifiers used for induction within a meta-learning framework. Compared to other baselines, FADM allows for flexible control over the categories of the generated samples and exhibits superior generalization capability. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that FADM achieves better accuracy and optimal fairness in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our method employs adversarial training to distill knowledge from existing large-scale image generation models, minimizing the reliance on annotated data and enhancing the diversity in generation. This distillation approach aligns the distribution of the generated materials with that of image textures from an SDXL model, enabling the generation of novel materials that are not present in the initial training dataset. Furthermore, we employ a diffusion-based refiner model to improve the visual quality of the samples and achieve high-resolution generation. Finally, we distill a latent consistency model for fast generation in just four steps and propose a new tileability technique that removes visual artifacts typically associated with fewer diffusion steps. We detail the architecture and training process of StableMaterials, the integration of semi-supervised training within existing LDM frameworks and show the advantages of our approach. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of StableMaterials, highlighting its potential applications in computer graphics and beyond.

Instead of conditioning on a sequence of text tokens, we propose to use a set of per-object representations, Neural Assets, to control the 3D pose of individual objects in a scene. Neural Assets are obtained by pooling visual representations of objects from a reference image, such as a frame in a video, and are trained to reconstruct the respective objects in a different image, e.g., a later frame in the video. Importantly, we encode object visuals from the reference image while conditioning on object poses from the target frame. This enables learning disentangled appearance and pose features. Combining visual and 3D pose representations in a sequence-of-tokens format allows us to keep the text-to-image architecture of existing models, with Neural Assets in place of text tokens. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with this information, our approach enables fine-grained 3D pose and placement control of individual objects in a scene. We further demonstrate that Neural Assets can be transferred and recomposed across different scenes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-object editing results on both synthetic 3D scene datasets, as well as two real-world video datasets (Objectron, Waymo Open).</p></details> | <details><summary>Addit...</summary><p>Additional details and video results are available at https://neural-assets-paper.github.io/</p></details> |

In recent SGMSE+ approaches, training involves a stochastic differential equation for the diffusion process, adding both Gaussian and environmental noise to the clean speech signal gradually. The speech enhancement performance varies depending on the choice of the stochastic differential equation that controls the evolution of the mean and the variance along the diffusion processes when adding environmental and Gaussian noise. In this work, we highlight that the scale of the variance is a dominant parameter for speech enhancement performance and show that it controls the tradeoff between noise attenuation and speech distortions. More concretely, we show that a larger variance increases the noise attenuation and allows for reducing the computational footprint, as fewer function evaluations for generating the estimate are required</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Recently, many methods and datasets have been proposed to tackle the grasp detection problem. However, most of them do not consider using natural language as a condition to detect the grasp poses. In this paper, we introduce Grasp-Anything++, a new language-driven grasp detection dataset featuring 1M samples, over 3M objects, and upwards of 10M grasping instructions. We utilize foundation models to create a large-scale scene corpus with corresponding images and grasp prompts. We approach the language-driven grasp detection task as a conditional generation problem. Drawing on the success of diffusion models in generative tasks and given that language plays a vital role in this task, we propose a new language-driven grasp detection method based on diffusion models. Our key contribution is the contrastive training objective, which explicitly contributes to the denoising process to detect the grasp pose given the language instructions. We illustrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. The intensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and allows real-world robotic grasping. Finally, we demonstrate our large-scale dataset enables zero-short grasp detection and is a challenging benchmark for future work.

Severe Data Leakage via Gradient-Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09484v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient leakage has been identified as a potential source of privacy breaches in modern image processing systems, where the adversary can completely reconstruct the training images from leaked gradients. However, existing methods are restricted to reconstructing low-resolution images where data leakage risks of image processing systems are not sufficiently explored. In this paper, by exploiting diffusion models, we propose an innovative gradient-guided fine-tuning method and introduce a new reconstruction attack that is capable of stealing private, high-resolution images from image processing systems through leaked gradients where severe data leakage encounters. Our attack method is easy to implement and requires little prior knowledge. The experimental results indicate that current reconstruction attacks can steal images only up to a resolution of $128 \times 128$ pixels, while our attack method can successfully recover and steal images with resolutions up to $512 \times 512$ pixels. Our attack method significantly outperforms the SOTA attack baselines in terms of both pixel-wise accuracy and time efficiency of image reconstruction. Furthermore, our attack can render differential privacy ineffective to some extent.</p></details> |  |

However, when facing multi-modal conditions, such as text combined with reference appearances, existing methods struggle to balance multiple conditions effectively, typically showing a preference for one modality over others. To address this challenge, we introduce EMMA, a novel image generation model accepting multi-modal prompts built upon the state-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, ELLA. EMMA seamlessly incorporates additional modalities alongside text to guide image generation through an innovative Multi-modal Feature Connector design, which effectively integrates textual and supplementary modal information using a special attention mechanism. By freezing all parameters in the original T2I diffusion model and only adjusting some additional layers, we reveal an interesting finding that the pre-trained T2I diffusion model can secretly accept multi-modal prompts. This interesting property facilitates easy adaptation to different existing frameworks, making EMMA a flexible and effective tool for producing personalized and context-aware images and even videos. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to assemble learned EMMA modules to produce images conditioned on multiple modalities simultaneously, eliminating the need for additional training with mixed multi-modal prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EMMA in maintaining high fidelity and detail in generated images, showcasing its potential as a robust solution for advanced multi-modal conditional image generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tencentqqgylab.github.io/EMMA</p></details> |

Recently, the audio denoising problem has been converted into an image generation task, and deep learning-based approaches have been applied to tackle this problem. However, its performance is still limited, leaving room for further improvement. In order to enhance audio denoising performance, this paper introduces a complex image-generative diffusion transformer that captures more information from the complex Fourier domain. We explore a novel diffusion transformer by integrating the transformer with a diffusion model. Our proposed model demonstrates the scalability of the transformer and expands the receptive field of sparse attention using attention diffusion. Our work is among the first to utilize diffusion transformers to deal with the image generation task for audio denoising. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | INTERSPEECH 2024 |

The unique property of the reverse process could recover clean signals. However, the distribution of real-world noises does not comply with a single Gaussian distribution and is even unknown. The sampling of Gaussian noise conditions limits its application scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a DiffGMM model, a denoising model based on the diffusion and Gaussian mixture models. We employ the reverse process to estimate parameters for the Gaussian mixture model. Given a noisy audio signal, we first apply a 1D-U-Net to extract features and train linear layers to estimate parameters for the Gaussian mixture model, and we approximate the real noise distributions. The noisy signal is continuously subtracted from the estimated noise to output clean audio signals. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DiffGMM model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | INTERSPEECH 2024 |

This paper argues that Markov diffusion models enjoy an advantage over other types of diffusion model, as their associated operators can be exploited to improve the training process. In particular, (i) there exists an explicit formal solution to the forward process as a sequence of time-dependent kernel mean embeddings; and (ii) the derivation of score-matching and related estimators can be streamlined. Building upon (i), we propose Riemannian diffusion kernel smoothing, which ameliorates the need for neural score approximation, at least in the low-dimensional context; Building upon (ii), we propose operator-informed score matching, a variance reduction technique that is straightforward to implement in both low- and high-dimensional diffusion modeling and is demonstrated to improve score matching in an empirical proof-of-concept.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 19 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Specifically, our approach is inspired by the recently proposed method for 2D image editing - Delta Denoising Score (DDS). We pinpoint the limitations in DDS for 2D and 3D editing, which causes detail loss and over-saturation. To address this, we propose an additional score distillation term that enforces identity preservation. This results in a more stable editing process, gradually optimizing NeRF models to match target prompts while retaining crucial input characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in zero-shot image and neural field editing. Our method successfully alters visual attributes, adds both subtle and substantial structural elements, translates shapes, and achieves competitive results on standard 2D and 3D editing benchmarks. Additionally, our method imposes no constraints like masking or pre-training, making it compatible with a wide range of pre-trained diffusion models. This allows for versatile editing without needing neural field-to-mesh conversion, offering a more user-friendly experience.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

Due to the dependency on digital media, a person shares important information or regular updates with friends and family. The set of persons on social media forms a social network. Influence Maximization (IM) is a known problem in social networks. In social networks, information flows from one person to another using an underlying diffusion model. There are two fundamental diffusion models: the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) and the Linear Threshold Model (LTM). In this paper, we study a variant of the IM problem called Minimum Influential Seeds (MINFS) problem proposed by Qiang et al.[16]. It generalizes the classical IM problem with LTM as the diffusion model. Compared to IM, this variant has additional parameters: the influence threshold for each node and the propagation range. The propagation range is a positive integer that specifies how far the information can propagate from a node. A node on the network is not immediately influenced until it receives the same information from enough number of neighbors (influence threshold). Similarly, any node does not forward information until it receives the same information from a sufficient number of neighbors (activation threshold). Once a node becomes activated, it tries to activate or influence its neighbors. The MINFS problem aims to select the minimum number of initial spreader nodes such that all nodes of the graph are influenced. In this paper, we extend the study of the MINFS problem. We propose heuristics that construct seed sets based on the average degree of non-activated nodes, closest first, and backbone-based heaviest path.</p></details> |  |

Currently, diffusion models have become the mainstream in visual generation research, owing to their robust generative capabilities. However, challenges persist in the realm of image-to-video, especially in character animation, where temporally maintaining consistency with detailed information from character remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image, we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity, we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames. By expanding the training data, our approach can animate arbitrary characters, yielding superior results in character animation compared to other image-to-video methods. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on benchmarks for fashion video and human dance synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://humanaigc.github.io/animate-anyone/</p></details> |

Previous methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) can produce diversified 3D results by distilling 3D knowledge from large 2D diffusion models, but they usually suffer from long per-case optimization time with inconsistent issues. Recent works address the problem and generate better 3D results either by finetuning a multi-view diffusion model or training a fast feed-forward model. However, they still lack intricate textures and complex geometries due to inconsistency and limited generated resolution. To simultaneously achieve high fidelity, consistency, and efficiency in single image-to-3D, we propose a novel framework Unique3D that includes a multi-view diffusion model with a corresponding normal diffusion model to generate multi-view images with their normal maps, a multi-level upscale process to progressively improve the resolution of generated orthographic multi-views, as well as an instant and consistent mesh reconstruction algorithm called ISOMER, which fully integrates the color and geometric priors into mesh results.

Despite extensive efforts, maintaining the temporal consistency of edited videos remains challenging due to the lack of temporal constraints in the regular T2I diffusion model. To address this issue, we propose COrrespondence-guided Video Editing (COVE), leveraging the inherent diffusion feature correspondence to achieve high-quality and consistent video editing. Specifically, we propose an efficient sliding-window-based strategy to calculate the similarity among tokens in the diffusion features of source videos, identifying the tokens with high correspondence across frames. During the inversion and denoising process, we sample the tokens in noisy latent based on the correspondence and then perform self-attention within them. To save GPU memory usage and accelerate the editing process, we further introduce the temporal-dimensional token merging strategy, which can effectively reduce redundancy. COVE can be seamlessly integrated into the pre-trained T2I diffusion model without the need for extra training or optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that COVE achieves the start-of-the-art performance in various video editing scenarios, outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code will be release at https://github.com/wangjiangshan0725/COVE</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel two-stage extreme image compression framework that exploits the powerful generative capability of pre-trained diffusion models to achieve realistic image reconstruction at extremely low bitrates. In the first stage, we treat the latent representation of images in the diffusion space as guidance, employing a VAE-based compression approach to compress images and initially decode the compressed information into content variables. The second stage leverages pre-trained stable diffusion to reconstruct images under the guidance of content variables. Specifically, we introduce a small control module to inject content information while keeping the stable diffusion model fixed to maintain its generative capability. Furthermore, we design a space alignment loss to force the content variables to align with the diffusion space and provide the necessary constraints for optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visual performance at extremely low bitrates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

This effect becomes more pronounced at higher values of adapter strength and for adapters with higher ranks which are fine-tuned on smaller datasets. To address these challenges, we present FouRA, a novel low-rank method that learns projections in the Fourier domain along with learning a flexible input-dependent adapter rank selection strategy. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that FouRA successfully solves the problems related to data copying and distribution collapse while significantly improving the generated image quality. We demonstrate that FouRA enhances the generalization of fine-tuned models thanks to its adaptive rank selection. We further show that the learned projections in the frequency domain are decorrelated and prove effective when merging multiple adapters. While FouRA is motivated for vision tasks, we also demonstrate its merits for language tasks on the GLUE benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To solve this issue, we first deeply analyze the SDS and find that its distillation sampling process indeed corresponds to the trajectory sampling of a stochastic differential equation (SDE): SDS samples along an SDE trajectory to yield a less noisy sample which then serves as a guidance to optimize a 3D model. However, the randomness in SDE sampling often leads to a diverse and unpredictable sample which is not always less noisy, and thus is not a consistently correct guidance, explaining the vulnerability of SDS. Since for any SDE, there always exists an ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose trajectory sampling can deterministically and consistently converge to the desired target point as the SDE, we propose a novel and effective "Consistent3D" method that explores the ODE deterministic sampling prior for text-to-3D generation. Specifically, at each training iteration, given a rendered image by a 3D model, we first estimate its desired 3D score function by a pre-trained 2D diffusion model, and build an ODE for trajectory sampling. Next, we design a consistency distillation sampling loss which samples along the ODE trajectory to generate two adjacent samples and uses the less noisy sample to guide another more noisy one for distilling the deterministic prior into the 3D model. Experimental results show the efficacy of our Consistent3D in generating high-fidelity and diverse 3D objects and large-scale scenes, as shown in Fig. 1.

Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

The new challenges posed by T2MVid generation lie in the lack of massive captioned multi-view videos and the complexity of modeling such multi-dimensional distribution. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based pipeline that generates high-quality multi-view videos centered around a dynamic 3D object from text. Specifically, we factor the T2MVid problem into viewpoint-space and time components. Such factorization allows us to combine and reuse layers of advanced pre-trained multi-view image and 2D video diffusion models to ensure multi-view consistency as well as temporal coherence for the generated multi-view videos, largely reducing the training cost. We further introduce alignment modules to align the latent spaces of layers from the pre-trained multi-view and the 2D video diffusion models, addressing the reused layers' incompatibility that arises from the domain gap between 2D and multi-view data. In support of this and future research, we further contribute a captioned multi-view video dataset.

While these diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, the underlying mechanisms driving their performance are not yet fully accounted for, with many unanswered questions surrounding what they learn, how they represent visual-semantic relationships, and why they sometimes fail to generalize. Our work presents Diffusion Partial Information Decomposition (DiffusionPID), a novel technique that applies information-theoretic principles to decompose the input text prompt into its elementary components, enabling a detailed examination of how individual tokens and their interactions shape the generated image. We introduce a formal approach to analyze the uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy terms by applying PID to the denoising model at both the image and pixel level. This approach enables us to characterize how individual tokens and their interactions affect the model output. We first present a fine-grained analysis of characteristics utilized by the model to uniquely localize specific concepts, we then apply our approach in bias analysis and show it can recover gender and ethnicity biases. Finally, we use our method to visually characterize word ambiguity and similarity from the model's perspective and illustrate the efficacy of our method for prompt intervention. Our results show that PID is a potent tool for evaluating and diagnosing text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we designed a guide to help readers develop a more critical eye toward identifying artifacts, inconsistencies, and implausibilities that often appear in AI-generated images. The guide is organized into five categories of artifacts and implausibilities: anatomical, stylistic, functional, violations of physics, and sociocultural. For this guide, we generated 138 images with diffusion models, curated 9 images from social media, and curated 42 real photographs. These images showcase the kinds of cues that prompt suspicion towards the possibility an image is AI-generated and why it is often difficult to draw conclusions about an image's provenance without any context beyond the pixels in an image. Human-perceptible artifacts are not always present in AI-generated images, but this guide reveals artifacts and implausibilities that often emerge. By drawing attention to these kinds of artifacts and implausibilities, we aim to better equip people to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 189 Figures</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing image-space detectors quickly become obsolete as new high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed at blinding speed. In this work, we propose a new synthetic image detector that uses features obtained by inverting an open-source pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We show that these inversion features enable our detector to generalize well to unseen generators of high visual fidelity (e.g., DALL-E 3) even when the detector is trained only on lower fidelity fake images generated via Stable Diffusion. This detector achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple training and evaluation setups. Moreover, we introduce a new challenging evaluation protocol that uses reverse image search to mitigate stylistic and thematic biases in the detector evaluation. We show that the resulting evaluation scores align well with detectors' in-the-wild performance, and release these datasets as public benchmarks for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fake-inversion.github.io</p></details> |

They facilitate interactive content creation and provides a foundation for grounded, long-horizon reasoning. Current foundation models do not fully meet the capabilities of general world models: large language models (LLMs) are constrained by their reliance on language modality and their limited understanding of the physical world, while video models lack interactive action control over the world simulations. This paper makes a step towards building a general world model by introducing Pandora, a hybrid autoregressive-diffusion model that simulates world states by generating videos and allows real-time control with free-text actions. Pandora achieves domain generality, video consistency, and controllability through large-scale pretraining and instruction tuning. Crucially, Pandora bypasses the cost of training-from-scratch by integrating a pretrained LLM (7B) and a pretrained video model, requiring only additional lightweight finetuning. We illustrate extensive outputs by Pandora across diverse domains (indoor/outdoor, natural/urban, human/robot, 2D/3D, etc.). The results indicate great potential of building stronger general world models with larger-scale training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://world-model.maitrix.org/</p></details> |

In this paper, we examine how prompts affect image variability in black-box diffusion-based models. We propose W1KP, a human-calibrated measure of variability in a set of images, bootstrapped from existing image-pair perceptual distances. Current datasets do not cover recent diffusion models, thus we curate three test sets for evaluation. Our best perceptual distance outperforms nine baselines by up to 18 points in accuracy, and our calibration matches graded human judgements 78% of the time. Using W1KP, we study prompt reusability and show that Imagen prompts can be reused for 10-50 random seeds before new images become too similar to already generated images, while Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 can be reused 50-200 times. Lastly, we analyze 56 linguistic features of real prompts, finding that the prompt's length, CLIP embedding norm, concreteness, and word senses influence variability most. As far as we are aware, we are the first to analyze diffusion variability from a visuolinguistic perspective. Our project page is at http://w1kp.com</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot provide multi-view shape priors with guaranteed 3D consistency. We propose Human 3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D Consistent Diffusion. Our key insight is that 2D multi-view diffusion and 3D reconstruction models provide complementary information for each other, and by coupling them in a tight manner, we can fully leverage the potential of both models. We introduce a novel image-conditioned generative 3D Gaussian Splats reconstruction model that leverages the priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models, and provides an explicit 3D representation, which further guides the 2D reverse sampling process to have better 3D consistency. Experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables the creation of realistic avatars from a single RGB image, achieving high-fidelity in both geometry and appearance. Extensive ablations also validate the efficacy of our design, (1) multi-view 2D priors conditioning in generative 3D reconstruction and (2) consistency refinement of sampling trajectory via the explicit 3D representation. Our code and models will be released on https://yuxuan-xue.com/human-3diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yuxuan-xue.com/human-3diffusion</p></details> |

By construction, our approach enables training-free continual learning and unlearning with no additional memory or inference costs, since models corresponding to data shards can be added or removed by re-averaging. We show that Diffusion Soup samples from a point in weight space that approximates the geometric mean of the distributions of constituent datasets, which offers anti-memorization guarantees and enables zero-shot style mixing. Empirically, Diffusion Soup outperforms a paragon model trained on the union of all data shards and achieves a 30% improvement in Image Reward (.34 $\to$ .44) on domain sharded data, and a 59% improvement in IR (.37 $\to$ .59) on aesthetic data. In both cases, souping also prevails in TIFA score (respectively, 85.5 $\to$ 86.5 and 85.6 $\to$ 86.8). We demonstrate robust unlearning -- removing any individual domain shard only lowers performance by 1% in IR (.45 $\to$ .44) -- and validate our theoretical insights on anti-memorization using real data. Finally, we showcase Diffusion Soup's ability to blend the distinct styles of models finetuned on different shards, resulting in the zero-shot generation of hybrid styles.</p></details> |  |
| **[FontStudio: Shape-Adaptive Diffusion Model for Coherent and Consistent Font Effect Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08392v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the application of modern diffusion-based text-to-image generation models for creating artistic fonts, traditionally the domain of professional designers, has garnered significant interest. Diverging from the majority of existing studies that concentrate on generating artistic typography, our research aims to tackle a novel and more demanding challenge: the generation of text effects for multilingual fonts. This task essentially requires generating coherent and consistent visual content within the confines of a font-shaped canvas, as opposed to a traditional rectangular canvas. To address this task, we introduce a novel shape-adaptive diffusion model capable of interpreting the given shape and strategically planning pixel distributions within the irregular canvas. To achieve this, we curate a high-quality shape-adaptive image-text dataset and incorporate the segmentation mask as a visual condition to steer the image generation process within the irregular-canvas. This approach enables the traditionally rectangle canvas-based diffusion model to produce the desired concepts in accordance with the provided geometric shapes. Second, to maintain consistency across multiple letters, we also present a training-free, shape-adaptive effect transfer method for transferring textures from a generated reference letter to others. The key insights are building a font effect noise prior and propagating the font effect information in a concatenated latent space. The efficacy of our FontStudio system is confirmed through user preference studies, which show a marked preference (78% win-rates on aesthetics) for our system even when compared to the latest unrivaled commercial product, Adobe Firefly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project-page: https://font-studio.github.io/</p></details> |

To address these issues, we introduce "Diff-A-Riff," a Latent Diffusion Model designed to generate high-quality instrumental accompaniments adaptable to any musical context. This model offers control through either audio references, text prompts, or both, and produces 48kHz pseudo-stereo audio while significantly reducing inference time and memory usage.

Reducing the tracer injection dose and eliminating the CT acquisition for attenuation correction can reduce the overall radiation dose, but often results in PET with high noise and bias. Thus, it is desirable to develop 3D methods to translate the non-attenuation-corrected low-dose PET (NAC-LDPET) into attenuation-corrected standard-dose PET (AC-SDPET). Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a new state-of-the-art deep learning method for image-to-image translation, better than traditional CNN-based methods. However, due to the high computation cost and memory burden, it is largely limited to 2D applications. To address these challenges, we developed a novel 2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model (MADM) for 3D image-to-image translation with application on NAC-LDPET to AC-SDPET translation. Specifically, MADM employs separate diffusion models for axial, coronal, and sagittal views, whose outputs are averaged in each sampling step to ensure the 3D generation quality from multiple views. To accelerate the 3D sampling process, we also proposed a strategy to use the CNN-based 3D generation as a prior for the diffusion model. Our experimental results on human patient studies suggested that MADM can generate high-quality 3D translation images, outperforming previous CNN-based and Diffusion-based baseline methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI is capable of coupling hundreds of degrees of freedom at once.</p></details> |  |

We propose WMAdapter, a diffusion model watermark plugin that takes user-specified watermark information and allows for seamless watermark imprinting during the diffusion generation process. WMAdapter is efficient and robust, with a strong emphasis on high generation quality. To achieve this, we make two key designs: (1) We develop a contextual adapter structure that is lightweight and enables effective knowledge transfer from heavily pretrained post-hoc watermarking models. (2) We introduce an extra finetuning step and design a hybrid finetuning strategy to further improve image quality and eliminate tiny artifacts. Empirical results demonstrate that WMAdapter offers strong flexibility, exceptional image generation quality and competitive watermark robustness.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Diffusion models for Gaussian distributions: Exact solutions and Wasserstein errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14250v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model with Cross Attention as an Inductive Bias for Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09712v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentangled representation learning strives to extract the intrinsic factors within observed data. Factorizing these representations in an unsupervised manner is notably challenging and usually requires tailored loss functions or specific structural designs. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective and framework, demonstrating that diffusion models with cross-attention can serve as a powerful inductive bias to facilitate the learning of disentangled representations. We propose to encode an image to a set of concept tokens and treat them as the condition of the latent diffusion for image reconstruction, where cross-attention over the concept tokens is used to bridge the interaction between the encoder and diffusion. Without any additional regularization, this framework achieves superior disentanglement performance on the benchmark datasets, surpassing all previous methods with intricate designs. We have conducted comprehensive ablation studies and visualization analysis, shedding light on the functioning of this model. This is the first work to reveal the potent disentanglement capability of diffusion models with cross-attention, requiring no complex designs. We anticipate that our findings will inspire more investigation on exploring diffusion for disentangled representation learning towards more sophisticated data analysis and understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12013v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. An example of numerical simulations for an hybrid classical-quantum generative diffusion model is also included. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |
| **[FIFO-Diffusion: Generating Infinite Videos from Text without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11473v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel inference technique based on a pretrained diffusion model for text-conditional video generation. Our approach, called FIFO-Diffusion, is conceptually capable of generating infinitely long videos without additional training. This is achieved by iteratively performing diagonal denoising, which concurrently processes a series of consecutive frames with increasing noise levels in a queue; our method dequeues a fully denoised frame at the head while enqueuing a new random noise frame at the tail. However, diagonal denoising is a double-edged sword as the frames near the tail can take advantage of cleaner ones by forward reference but such a strategy induces the discrepancy between training and inference. Hence, we introduce latent partitioning to reduce the training-inference gap and lookahead denoising to leverage the benefit of forward referencing. Practically, FIFO-Diffusion consumes a constant amount of memory regardless of the target video length given a baseline model, while well-suited for parallel inference on multiple GPUs. We have demonstrated the promising results and effectiveness of the proposed methods on existing text-to-video generation baselines. Generated video samples and source codes are available at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jjihwan.github.io/projects/FIFO-Diffusion</p></details> |

Data augmentations typically incorporate inductive biases about the image formation process into the training (e.g. translation, scaling, colour changes, etc.). Here, we go beyond simple pixel transformations and introduce the concept of instance-level data augmentation by repainting parts of the image at the level of object instances. The method combines a conditional diffusion model with depth and edge maps control conditioning to seamlessly repaint individual objects inside the scene, being applicable to any segmentation or detection dataset. Used as a data augmentation method, it improves the performance and generalization of the state-of-the-art salient object detection, semantic segmentation and object detection models. By redrawing all privacy-sensitive instances (people, license plates, etc.), the method is also applicable for data anonymization. We also release fully synthetic and anonymized expansions for popular datasets: COCO, Pascal VOC and DUTS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Promoted HDR Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08204v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High dynamic range (HDR) video reconstruction aims to generate HDR videos from low dynamic range (LDR) frames captured with alternating exposures. Most existing works solely rely on the regression-based paradigm, leading to adverse effects such as ghosting artifacts and missing details in saturated regions. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-promoted method for HDR video reconstruction, termed HDR-V-Diff, which incorporates a diffusion model to capture the HDR distribution. As such, HDR-V-Diff can reconstruct HDR videos with realistic details while alleviating ghosting artifacts. However, the direct introduction of video diffusion models would impose massive computational burden. Instead, to alleviate this burden, we first propose an HDR Latent Diffusion Model (HDR-LDM) to learn the distribution prior of single HDR frames. Specifically, HDR-LDM incorporates a tonemapping strategy to compress HDR frames into the latent space and a novel exposure embedding to aggregate the exposure information into the diffusion process. We then propose a Temporal-Consistent Alignment Module (TCAM) to learn the temporal information as a complement for HDR-LDM, which conducts coarse-to-fine feature alignment at different scales among video frames. Finally, we design a Zero-Init Cross-Attention (ZiCA) mechanism to effectively integrate the learned distribution prior and temporal information for generating HDR frames. Extensive experiments validate that HDR-V-Diff achieves state-of-the-art results on several representative datasets.</p></details> | Arxiv Preprint |

Nevertheless, the quality of samples generated by diffusion models still needs improvement. And the effectiveness of the method is accompanied by the extensive number of sampling steps, leading to an extended synthesis time necessary for generating high-quality audio. Previous Text-to-Audio (TTA) methods mostly used diffusion models in the latent space for audio generation. In this paper, we explore the integration of the Flow Matching (FM) model into the audio latent space for audio generation. The FM is an alternative simulation-free method that trains continuous normalization flows (CNF) based on regressing vector fields. We demonstrate that our model significantly enhances the quality of generated audio samples, achieving better performance than prior models. Moreover, it reduces the number of inference steps to ten steps almost without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech2024</p></details> |

Previous methods typically require the training of models to encode motion cues or the fine-tuning of video diffusion models. However, these approaches often result in suboptimal motion generation when applied outside the trained domain. In this work, we propose MotionClone, a training-free framework that enables motion cloning from a reference video to control text-to-video generation. We employ temporal attention in video inversion to represent the motions in the reference video and introduce primary temporal-attention guidance to mitigate the influence of noisy or very subtle motions within the attention weights. Furthermore, to assist the generation model in synthesizing reasonable spatial relationships and enhance its prompt-following capability, we propose a location-aware semantic guidance mechanism that leverages the coarse location of the foreground from the reference video and original classifier-free guidance features to guide the video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionClone exhibits proficiency in both global camera motion and local object motion, with notable superiority in terms of motion fidelity, textual alignment, and temporal consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures, https://bujiazi.github.io/motionclone.github.io/</p></details> |

The task can be decomposed into two sub-problems: (1) speech-driven lip motion generation and (2) visual appearance synthesis. Current solutions handle the two sub-problems within a single generative model, resulting in a challenging trade-off between lip-sync quality and visual details preservation. Instead, we propose to disentangle the motion and appearance, and then generate them one by one with a speech-to-motion diffusion model and a motion-conditioned appearance generation model. However, there still remain challenges in each stage, such as motion-aware identity preservation in (1) and visual details preservation in (2). Therefore, to preserve personal identity, we adopt landmarks to represent the motion, and further employ a landmark-based identity loss. To capture motion-agnostic visual details, we use separate encoders to encode the lip, non-lip appearance and motion, and then integrate them with a learned fusion module. We train MyTalk on a large-scale and diverse dataset. Experiments show that our method generalizes well to the unknown, even out-of-domain person, in terms of both lip sync and visual detail preservation.

Pushing Image Generation at Higher-Resolutions with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07251v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce Pixelsmith, a zero-shot text-to-image generative framework to sample images at higher resolutions with a single GPU. We are the first to show that it is possible to scale the output of a pre-trained diffusion model by a factor of 1000, opening the road for gigapixel image generation at no additional cost. Our cascading method uses the image generated at the lowest resolution as a baseline to sample at higher resolutions. For the guidance, we introduce the Slider, a tunable mechanism that fuses the overall structure contained in the first-generated image with enhanced fine details. At each inference step, we denoise patches rather than the entire latent space, minimizing memory demands such that a single GPU can handle the process, regardless of the image's resolution. Our experimental results show that Pixelsmith not only achieves higher quality and diversity compared to existing techniques, but also reduces sampling time and artifacts.

| **[CFG++: Manifold-constrained Classifier Free Guidance for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08070v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a fundamental tool in modern diffusion models for text-guided generation. Although effective, CFG has notable drawbacks. For instance, DDIM with CFG lacks invertibility, complicating image editing; furthermore, high guidance scales, essential for high-quality outputs, frequently result in issues like mode collapse. Contrary to the widespread belief that these are inherent limitations of diffusion models, this paper reveals that the problems actually stem from the off-manifold phenomenon associated with CFG, rather than the diffusion models themselves. More specifically, inspired by the recent advancements of diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS), we reformulate text-guidance as an inverse problem with a text-conditioned score matching loss, and develop CFG++, a novel approach that tackles the off-manifold challenges inherent in traditional CFG. CFG++ features a surprisingly simple fix to CFG, yet it offers significant improvements, including better sample quality for text-to-image generation, invertibility, smaller guidance scales, reduced mode collapse, etc. Furthermore, CFG++ enables seamless interpolation between unconditional and conditional sampling at lower guidance scales, consistently outperforming traditional CFG at all scales. Experimental results confirm that our method significantly enhances performance in text-to-image generation, DDIM inversion, editing, and solving inverse problems, suggesting a wide-ranging impact and potential applications in various fields that utilize text guidance.

| **[Exploring One-shot Semi-supervised Federated Learning with A Pre-trained Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04063v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, semi-supervised federated learning (semi-FL) has been proposed to handle the commonly seen real-world scenarios with labeled data on the server and unlabeled data on the clients. However, existing methods face several challenges such as communication costs, data heterogeneity, and training pressure on client devices. To address these challenges, we introduce the powerful diffusion models (DM) into semi-FL and propose FedDISC, a Federated Diffusion-Inspired Semi-supervised Co-training method. Specifically, we first extract prototypes of the labeled server data and use these prototypes to predict pseudo-labels of the client data. For each category, we compute the cluster centroids and domain-specific representations to signify the semantic and stylistic information of their distributions. After adding noise, these representations are sent back to the server, which uses the pre-trained DM to generate synthetic datasets complying with the client distributions and train a global model on it. With the assistance of vast knowledge within DM, the synthetic datasets have comparable quality and diversity to the client images, subsequently enabling the training of global models that achieve performance equivalent to or even surpassing the ceiling of supervised centralized training. FedDISC works within one communication round, does not require any local training, and involves very minimal information uploading, greatly enhancing its practicality. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that FedDISC effectively addresses the semi-FL problem on non-IID clients and outperforms the compared SOTA methods. Sufficient visualization experiments also illustrate that the synthetic dataset generated by FedDISC exhibits comparable diversity and quality to the original client dataset, with a neglectable possibility of leaking privacy-sensitive information of the clients.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-24 |
| **[Classification Diffusion Models: Revitalizing Density Ratio Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10095v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prominent family of methods for learning data distributions relies on density ratio estimation (DRE), where a model is trained to $\textit{classify}$ between data samples and samples from some reference distribution. DRE-based models can directly output the likelihood for any given input, a highly desired property that is lacking in most generative techniques. Nevertheless, to date, DRE methods have struggled to accurately capture the distributions of complex high-dimensional data like images, which led to reduced research attention over the years. In this work we present $\textit{classification diffusion models}$ (CDMs), a DRE-based generative method that adopts the formalism of denoising diffusion models (DDMs) while making use of a classifier that predicts the level of noise added to a clean signal. Our method is based on an analytical connection that we derive between an MSE-optimal denoiser for white Gaussian noise and a cross-entropy-optimal classifier for predicting the noise level. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first DRE-based technique that can successfully generate images. Furthermore, it can output the likelihood of any input in a single forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art negative log likelihood (NLL) among methods with this property.

This difficulty raises scientific and regulatory questions, and is a consequence of the complexity of diffusion models and their sampling process. To analyze this dependence, we introduce Ablation Based Counterfactuals (ABC), a method of performing counterfactual analysis that relies on model ablation rather than model retraining. In our approach, we train independent components of a model on different but overlapping splits of a training set. These components are then combined into a single model, from which the causal influence of any training sample can be removed by ablating a combination of model components. We demonstrate how we can construct a model like this using an ensemble of diffusion models. We then use this model to study the limits of training data attribution by enumerating full counterfactual landscapes, and show that single source attributability diminishes with increasing training data size. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of unattributable samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, appendix included</p></details> |

Traditional Machine Learning approaches while effective, face challenges in real-world data due to varying optimal feature sets, subjectivity in human-driven design, biases, and limitations. Traditional approaches encounter the curse of dimensionality, struggle with feature selection and extraction, lack spatial information consideration, exhibit limited robustness to noise, face scalability issues, and may not adapt well to complex data distributions. In recent years, DL techniques have emerged as powerful tools for addressing these challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current trends and future prospects in HSC, focusing on the advancements from DL models to the emerging use of Transformers. We review the key concepts, methodologies, and state-of-the-art approaches in DL for HSC. We explore the potential of Transformer-based models in HSC, outlining their benefits and challenges. We also delve into emerging trends in HSC, as well as thorough discussions on Explainable AI and Interoperability concepts along with Diffusion Models (image denoising, feature extraction, and image fusion). Additionally, we address several open challenges and research questions pertinent to HSC. Comprehensive experimental results have been undertaken using three HS datasets to verify the efficacy of various conventional DL models and Transformers. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential applications that can further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of HSC.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jaewoopudding/GTA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Spotlight) to ICLR 2024 Workshop on Generative Models for Decision Making.

We propose DiffPop, the first framework that utilizes plausibility-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model to learn the scale and spatial relations among multiple objects and the corresponding scene image. First, we train an unguided diffusion model to directly learn the object placement parameters in a self-supervised manner. Then, we develop a human-in-the-loop pipeline which exploits human labeling on the diffusion-generated composite images to provide the weak supervision for training a structural plausibility classifier. The classifier is further used to guide the diffusion sampling process towards generating the plausible object placement. Experimental results verify the superiority of our method for producing plausible and diverse composite images on the new Cityscapes-OP dataset and the public OPA dataset, as well as demonstrate its potential in applications such as data augmentation and multi-object placement tasks. Our dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLCM: Multistep Consistency Distillation of Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05768v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling large latent diffusion models (LDMs) into ones that are fast to sample from is attracting growing research interest. However, the majority of existing methods face a dilemma where they either (i) depend on multiple individual distilled models for different sampling budgets, or (ii) sacrifice generation quality with limited (e.g., 2-4) and/or moderate (e.g., 5-8) sampling steps. To address these, we extend the recent multistep consistency distillation (MCD) strategy to representative LDMs, establishing the Multistep Latent Consistency Models (MLCMs) approach for low-cost high-quality image synthesis. MLCM serves as a unified model for various sampling steps due to the promise of MCD. We further augment MCD with a progressive training strategy to strengthen inter-segment consistency to boost the quality of few-step generations. We take the states from the sampling trajectories of the teacher model as training data for MLCMs to lift the requirements for high-quality training datasets and to bridge the gap between the training and inference of the distilled model. MLCM is compatible with preference learning strategies for further improvement of visual quality and aesthetic appeal. Empirically, MLCM can generate high-quality, delightful images with only 2-8 sampling steps. On the MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark, MLCM distilled from SDXL gets a CLIP Score of 33.30, Aesthetic Score of 6.19, and Image Reward of 1.20 with only 4 steps, substantially surpassing 4-step LCM [23], 8-step SDXL-Lightning [17], and 8-step HyperSD [33]. We also demonstrate the versatility of MLCMs in applications including controllable generation, image style transfer, and Chinese-to-image generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Short Film Dataset (SFD): A Benchmark for Story-Level Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10221v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly propelled video understanding. Existing datasets and tasks, however, have notable limitations. Most datasets are confined to short videos with limited events and narrow narratives. For example, datasets with instructional and egocentric videos often document the activities of one person in a single scene. Although some movie datasets offer richer content, they are often limited to short-term tasks, lack publicly available videos and frequently encounter data leakage given the use of movie forums and other resources in LLM training. To address the above limitations, we propose the Short Film Dataset (SFD) with 1,078 publicly available amateur movies, a wide variety of genres and minimal data leakage issues. SFD offers long-term story-oriented video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. Our extensive experiments emphasize the need for long-term reasoning to solve SFD tasks. Notably, we find strong signals in movie transcripts leading to the on-par performance of people and LLMs. We also show significantly lower performance of current models compared to people when using vision data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[DevBench: A multimodal developmental benchmark for language learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10215v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How (dis)similar are the learning trajectories of vision-language models and children? Recent modeling work has attempted to understand the gap between models' and humans' data efficiency by constructing models trained on less data, especially multimodal naturalistic data. However, such models are often evaluated on adult-level benchmarks, with limited breadth in language abilities tested, and without direct comparison to behavioral data. We introduce DevBench, a multimodal benchmark comprising seven language evaluation tasks spanning the domains of lexical, syntactic, and semantic ability, with behavioral data from both children and adults. We evaluate a set of vision-language models on these tasks, comparing models and humans not only on accuracy but on their response patterns. Across tasks, models exhibit variation in their closeness to human response patterns, and models that perform better on a task also more closely resemble human behavioral responses. We also examine the developmental trajectory of OpenCLIP over training, finding that greater training results in closer approximations to adult response patterns. DevBench thus provides a benchmark for comparing models to human language development. These comparisons highlight ways in which model and human language learning processes diverge, providing insight into entry points for improving language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting and Evaluating Medical Hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10185v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly integral to healthcare applications, including medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. While these models inherit the robust capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), they also inherit susceptibility to hallucinations-a significant concern in high-stakes medical contexts where the margin for error is minimal. However, currently, there are no dedicated methods or benchmarks for hallucination detection and evaluation in the medical field. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically designed for hallucination detection and evaluation within the medical multimodal domain. This benchmark provides multi-tasking hallucination support, multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization. Furthermore, we propose the MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric designed to assess LVLMs' hallucinations through a hierarchical scoring system that considers the severity and type of hallucination, thereby enabling a granular assessment of potential clinical impacts. We also present MediHallDetector, a novel Medical LVLM engineered for precise hallucination detection, which employs multitask training for hallucination detection. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish baselines for popular LVLMs using our benchmark. The findings indicate that MediHall Score provides a more nuanced understanding of hallucination impacts compared to traditional metrics and demonstrate the enhanced performance of MediHallDetector. We hope this work can significantly improve the reliability of LVLMs in medical applications. All resources of this work will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we show preliminary results on predicting language commentary alongside the driving output. CarLLaVA uses a semi-disentangled output representation of both path predictions and waypoints, getting the advantages of the path for better lateral control and the waypoints for better longitudinal control. We propose an efficient training recipe to train on large driving datasets without wasting compute on easy, trivial data.

Although CLIP has demonstrated remarkable performance, training it from scratch on noisy web-scale datasets is computationally demanding. On the other hand, mask-then-predict pre-training approaches, like Masked Image Modeling (MIM), offer efficient self-supervised learning for single-modal representations. This paper introduces Unmasked Token Alignment (UTA), a method that leverages existing CLIP models to further enhance its vision-language representations. UTA trains a Vision Transformer (ViT) by aligning unmasked visual tokens to the corresponding image tokens from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, which automatically aligns the ViT model with the CLIP text encoder. The pre-trained ViT can be directly applied for zero-shot evaluation even without training on image-text pairs. Compared to MIM approaches, UTA does not suffer from training-finetuning inconsistency and is much more training-efficient by avoiding using the extra [MASK] tokens. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UTA can enhance CLIP models and outperform existing MIM methods on various uni- and multi-modal benchmarks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/jihaonew/UTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR; Code and models are available at https://github.com/jihaonew/UTA</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Few-Shot Object Detection with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14494v3)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The era of vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large web-scale datasets challenges conventional formulations of "open-world" perception. In this work, we revisit the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in the context of recent foundational VLMs. First, we point out that zero-shot VLMs such as GroundingDINO significantly outperform state-of-the-art few-shot detectors (48 vs. 33 AP) on COCO. Despite their strong zero-shot performance, such foundational models may still be sub-optimal. For example, trucks on the web may be defined differently from trucks for a target application such as autonomous vehicle perception. We argue that the task of few-shot recognition can be reformulated as aligning foundation models to target concepts using a few examples. Interestingly, such examples can be multi-modal, using both text and visual cues, mimicking instructions that are often given to human annotators when defining a target concept of interest. Concretely, we propose Foundational FSOD, a new benchmark protocol that evaluates detectors pre-trained on any external datasets and fine-tuned on multi-modal (text and visual) K-shot examples per target class. We repurpose nuImages for Foundational FSOD, benchmark several popular open-source VLMs, and provide an empirical analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2024 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 23.9 mAP!</p></details> |  |
| **[Details Make a Difference: Object State-Sensitive Neurorobotic Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09988v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The state of an object reflects its current status or condition and is important for a robot's task planning and manipulation. However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach. The code for OSSA is available at \url{https://github.com/Xiao-wen-Sun/OSSA}</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study Into What Matters for Calibrating Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07417v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the dominant approach for zero-shot recognition, adept at handling diverse scenarios and significant distribution changes. However, their deployment in risk-sensitive areas requires a deeper understanding of their uncertainty estimation capabilities, a relatively uncharted area. In this study, we explore the calibration properties of VLMs across different architectures, datasets, and training strategies. In particular, we analyze the uncertainty estimation performance of VLMs when calibrated in one domain, label set or hierarchy level, and tested in a different one. Our findings reveal that while VLMs are not inherently calibrated for uncertainty, temperature scaling significantly and consistently improves calibration, even across shifts in distribution and changes in label set. Moreover, VLMs can be calibrated with a very small set of examples. Through detailed experimentation, we highlight the potential applications and importance of our insights, aiming for more reliable and effective use of VLMs in critical, real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Inspired by the prevalent use of the "Cookie Theft" task in human cognition test, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark to evaluate high-level cognitive ability of LVLMs using images with rich semantics. It defines eight reasoning capabilities and consists of an image description task and a visual question answering task. Our evaluation on well-known LVLMs shows that there is still a large gap in cognitive ability between LVLMs and humans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-Driven Closed-Loop Grasping with Model-Predictive Trajectory Replanning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09039v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining a vision module inside a closed-loop control system for a \emph{seamless movement} of a robot in a manipulation task is challenging due to the inconsistent update rates between utilized modules. This task is even more difficult in a dynamic environment, e.g., objects are moving. This paper presents a \emph{modular} zero-shot framework for language-driven manipulation of (dynamic) objects through a closed-loop control system with real-time trajectory replanning and an online 6D object pose localization. We segment an object within $\SI{0.5}{\second}$ by leveraging a vision language model via language commands. Then, guided by natural language commands, a closed-loop system, including a unified pose estimation and tracking and online trajectory planning, is utilized to continuously track this object and compute the optimal trajectory in real-time. Our proposed zero-shot framework provides a smooth trajectory that avoids jerky movements and ensures the robot can grasp a non-stationary object. Experiment results exhibit the real-time capability of the proposed zero-shot modular framework for the trajectory optimization module to accurately and efficiently grasp moving objects, i.e., up to \SI{30}{\hertz} update rates for the online 6D pose localization module and \SI{10}{\hertz} update rates for the receding-horizon trajectory optimization. These advantages highlight the modular framework's potential applications in robotics and human-robot interaction; see the video in https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/6e64/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Vision Language Modeling of Content, Distortion and Appearance for Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09858v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual quality of an image is confounded by a number of intertwined factors including its semantic content, distortion characteristics and appearance properties such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and colourfulness. Distilling high level knowledge about all these quality bearing attributes is crucial for developing objective Image Quality Assessment (IQA).While existing solutions have modeled some of these aspects, a comprehensive solution that involves all these important quality related attributes has not yet been developed. In this paper, we present a new blind IQA (BIQA) model termed Self-supervision and Vision-Language supervision Image QUality Evaluator (SLIQUE) that features a joint vision-language and visual contrastive representation learning framework for acquiring high level knowledge about the images semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties for IQA. For training SLIQUE, we have developed a systematic approach to constructing a first of its kind large image database annotated with all three categories of quality relevant texts. The Text Annotated Distortion, Appearance and Content (TADAC) database has over 1.6 million images annotated with textual descriptions of their semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties. The method for constructing TADAC and the database itself will be particularly useful for exploiting vision-language modeling for advanced IQA applications. Extensive experimental results show that SLIQUE has superior performances over state of the art, demonstrating the soundness of its design principle and the effectiveness of its implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Models Meet Meteorology: Developing Models for Extreme Weather Events Detection with Heatmaps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09838v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time detection and prediction of extreme weather protect human lives and infrastructure. Traditional methods rely on numerical threshold setting and manual interpretation of weather heatmaps with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which can be slow and error-prone. Our research redefines Extreme Weather Events Detection (EWED) by framing it as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) problem, thereby introducing a more precise and automated solution. Leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLM) to simultaneously process visual and textual data, we offer an effective aid to enhance the analysis process of weather heatmaps. Our initial assessment of general-purpose VLMs (e.g., GPT-4-Vision) on EWED revealed poor performance, characterized by low accuracy and frequent hallucinations due to inadequate color differentiation and insufficient meteorological knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce ClimateIQA, the first meteorological VQA dataset, which includes 8,760 wind gust heatmaps and 254,040 question-answer pairs covering four question types, both generated from the latest climate reanalysis data. We also propose Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), an innovative technique that leverages OpenCV and K-Means clustering to capture and depict color contours in heatmaps, providing ClimateIQA with more accurate color spatial location information. Finally, we present Climate-Zoo, the first meteorological VLM collection, which adapts VLMs to meteorological applications using the ClimateIQA dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that models from Climate-Zoo substantially outperform state-of-the-art general VLMs, achieving an accuracy increase from 0% to over 90% in EWED verification. The datasets and models in this study are publicly available for future climate science research: https://github.com/AlexJJJChen/Climate-Zoo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI-based Prompt Evolution Engineering Design Optimization With Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09143v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engineering design optimization requires an efficient combination of a 3D shape representation, an optimization algorithm, and a design performance evaluation method, which is often computationally expensive. We present a prompt evolution design optimization (PEDO) framework contextualized in a vehicle design scenario that leverages a vision-language model for penalizing impractical car designs synthesized by a generative model. The backbone of our framework is an evolutionary strategy coupled with an optimization objective function that comprises a physics-based solver and a vision-language model for practical or functional guidance in the generated car designs. In the prompt evolutionary search, the optimizer iteratively generates a population of text prompts, which embed user specifications on the aerodynamic performance and visual preferences of the 3D car designs. Then, in addition to the computational fluid dynamics simulations, the pre-trained vision-language model is used to penalize impractical designs and, thus, foster the evolutionary algorithm to seek more viable designs. Our investigations on a car design optimization problem show a wide spread of potential car designs generated at the early phase of the search, which indicates a good diversity of designs in the initial populations, and an increase of over 20\% in the probability of generating practical designs compared to a baseline framework without using a vision-language model. Visual inspection of the designs against the performance results demonstrates prompt evolution as a very promising paradigm for finding novel designs with good optimization performance while providing ease of use in specifying design specifications and preferences via a natural language interface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to be published in IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2024.

In this paper, we introduce a zero-shot, open-vocabulary diffusion policy method for robot manipulation. Using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), our method transforms linguistic task descriptions into actionable keyframes in 3D space. These keyframes serve to guide the diffusion process via inpainting. However, naively enforcing the diffusion process to adhere to the generated keyframes is problematic: the keyframes from the VLMs may be incorrect and lead to out-of-distribution (OOD) action sequences where the diffusion model performs poorly. To address these challenges, we develop an inpainting optimization strategy that balances adherence to the keyframes v.s. the training data distribution. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of traditional fine-tuned language-conditioned methods in both simulated and real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on basic abilities using nonverbal methods, such as yes-no and multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing AlignMMBench, a comprehensive alignment benchmark specifically designed for emerging Chinese VLMs. This benchmark is meticulously curated from real-world scenarios and Chinese Internet sources, encompassing thirteen specific tasks across three categories, and includes both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Incorporating a prompt rewrite strategy, AlignMMBench encompasses 1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs. To facilitate the evaluation pipeline, we propose CritiqueVLM, a rule-calibrated evaluator that exceeds GPT-4's evaluation ability. Finally, we report the performance of representative VLMs on AlignMMBench, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of different VLM architectures.

| **[Open-Vocabulary Calibration for Fine-tuned CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04655v4)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as formidable tools, showing their strong capability in handling various open-vocabulary tasks in image recognition, text-driven visual content generation, and visual chatbots, to name a few. In recent years, considerable efforts and resources have been devoted to adaptation methods for improving downstream performance of VLMs, particularly on parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like prompt learning. However, a crucial aspect that has been largely overlooked is the confidence calibration problem in fine-tuned VLMs, which could greatly reduce reliability when deploying such models in the real world. This paper bridges the gap by systematically investigating the confidence calibration problem in the context of prompt learning and reveals that existing calibration methods are insufficient to address the problem, especially in the open-vocabulary setting. To solve the problem, we present a simple and effective approach called Distance-Aware Calibration (DAC), which is based on scaling the temperature using as guidance the distance between predicted text labels and base classes. The experiments with 7 distinct prompt learning methods applied across 11 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAC, which achieves high efficacy without sacrificing the inference speed.

However, their computational costs are also escalating dramatically, making model acceleration exceedingly critical. To pursue more efficient vision-language Transformers, this paper introduces Cross-Guided Ensemble of Tokens (CrossGET), a general acceleration framework for vision-language Transformers. This framework adaptively combines tokens in real-time during inference, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance. CrossGET features two primary innovations: 1) Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble. CrossGET leverages cross-modal guided token matching and ensemble to effectively utilize cross-modal information, achieving wider applicability across both modality-independent models, e.g., CLIP, and modality-dependent ones, e.g., BLIP2. 2) Complete-Graph Soft Matching. CrossGET introduces an algorithm for the token-matching mechanism, ensuring reliable matching results while facilitating parallelizability and high efficiency. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, image captioning, and visual question answering.

| **[Too Many Frames, not all Useful:Efficient Strategies for Long-Form Video QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09396v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form videos that span across wide temporal intervals are highly information redundant and contain multiple distinct events or entities that are often loosely-related. Therefore, when performing long-form video question answering (LVQA),all information necessary to generate a correct response can often be contained within a small subset of frames. Recent literature explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in LVQA benchmarks, achieving exceptional performance, while relying on vision language models (VLMs) to convert all visual content within videos into natural language. Such VLMs often independently caption a large number of frames uniformly sampled from long videos, which is not efficient and can mostly be redundant. Questioning these decision choices, we explore optimal strategies for key-frame selection and sequence-aware captioning, that can significantly reduce these redundancies. We propose two novel approaches that improve each of aspects, namely Hierarchical Keyframe Selector and Sequential Visual LLM. Our resulting framework termed LVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark LVQA datasets. Our code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Domain Adaptation through Prompt Gradient Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09353v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods often aim to train a domain-invariant feature extractor, which may hinder the model from learning sufficiently discriminative features. To tackle this, a line of works based on prompt learning leverages the power of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to learn both domain-invariant and specific features through a set of domain-agnostic and domain-specific learnable prompts. Those studies typically enforce invariant constraints on representation, output, or prompt space to learn such prompts. Differently, we cast UDA as a multiple-objective optimization problem in which each objective is represented by a domain loss. Under this new framework, we propose aligning per-objective gradients to foster consensus between them. Additionally, to prevent potential overfitting when fine-tuning this deep learning architecture, we penalize the norm of these gradients. To achieve these goals, we devise a practical gradient update procedure that can work under both single-source and multi-source UDA. Empirically, our method consistently surpasses other prompt-based baselines by a large margin on different UDA benchmarks</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

It introduces a new automated benchmark construction method for this evaluation. The experiment compared common LVLMs with human participants using a mixed dataset of AI and human-created images. Results showed that LVLMs could distinguish between the image types to some extent but exhibited a rightward bias, and perform significantly worse compared to humans. To build on these findings, we developed an automated benchmark construction process using AI. This process involved topic retrieval, narrative script generation, error embedding, and image generation, creating a diverse set of text-image pairs with intentional errors. We validated our method through constructing two caparable benchmarks. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LVLMs in real-world understanding and advances benchmark construction techniques, providing a scalable and automatic approach for AI model evaluation.</p></details> |  |

While existing defenses excel in unimodal contexts, they currently fall short in safeguarding VLMs against adversarial threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel, yet elegantly simple approach for detecting adversarial samples in VLMs. Our method leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate images based on captions produced by target VLMs. Subsequently, we calculate the similarities of the embeddings of both input and generated images in the feature space to identify adversarial samples. Empirical evaluations conducted on different datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming baseline methods adapted from image classification domains. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability and model-agnostic nature. Theoretical analyses and empirical findings also show the resilience of our approach against adaptive attacks, positioning it as an excellent defense mechanism for real-world deployment against adversarial threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[INS-MMBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating LVLMs' Performance in Insurance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09105v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various general multimodal applications such as image recognition and visual reasoning, and have also shown promising potential in specialized domains. However, the application potential of LVLMs in the insurance domain-characterized by rich application scenarios and abundant multimodal data-has not been effectively explored. There is no systematic review of multimodal tasks in the insurance domain, nor a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance domain. In this paper, we systematically review and distill multimodal tasks for four representative types of insurance: auto insurance, property insurance, health insurance, and agricultural insurance. We propose INS-MMBench, the first comprehensive LVLMs benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench comprises a total of 2.2K thoroughly designed multiple-choice questions, covering 12 meta-tasks and 22 fundamental tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple representative LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like BLIP-2. This evaluation not only validates the effectiveness of our benchmark but also provides an in-depth performance analysis of current LVLMs on various multimodal tasks in the insurance domain. We hope that INS-MMBench will facilitate the further application of LVLMs in the insurance domain and inspire interdisciplinary development. Our dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/FDU-INS/INS-MMBench.</p></details> |  |

An analysis of multi-object representations in vision-language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09067v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forming and using symbol-like structured representations for reasoning has been considered essential for generalising over novel inputs. The primary tool that allows generalisation outside training data distribution is the ability to abstract away irrelevant information into a compact form relevant to the task. An extreme form of such abstract representations is symbols. Humans make use of symbols to bind information while abstracting away irrelevant parts to utilise the information consistently and meaningfully. This work estimates the state of such structured representations in vision encoders. Specifically, we evaluate image encoders in large vision-language pre-trained models to address the question of which desirable properties their representations lack by applying the criteria of symbolic structured reasoning described for LLMs to the image models. We test the representation space of image encoders like VIT, BLIP, CLIP, and FLAVA to characterise the distribution of the object representations in these models. In particular, we create decoding tasks using multi-object scenes from the COCO dataset, relating the token space to its input content for various objects in the scene. We use these tasks to characterise the network's token and layer-wise information modelling. Our analysis highlights that the CLS token, used for the downstream task, only focuses on a few objects necessary for the trained downstream task. Still, other individual objects are well-modelled separately by the tokens in the network originating from those objects. We further observed a widespread distribution of scene information. This demonstrates that information is far more entangled in tokens than optimal for representing objects similar to symbols. Given these symbolic properties, we show the network dynamics that cause failure modes of these models on basic downstream tasks in a multi-object scene.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) offers the chance to create advanced GUI agents. To ensure their effectiveness, there's a pressing need for qualified benchmarks that provide trustworthy and reproducible evaluations -- a challenge current benchmarks often fail to address. To tackle this issue, we introduce Mobile-Env, a comprehensive toolkit tailored for creating GUI benchmarks in the Android mobile environment. Mobile-Env offers an isolated and controllable setting for reliable evaluations, and accommodates intermediate instructions and rewards to reflect real-world usage more naturally. Utilizing Mobile-Env, we collect an open-world task set across various real-world apps and a fixed world set, WikiHow, which captures a significant amount of dynamic online contents for fully controllable and reproducible evaluation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of LLM agents using these benchmarks. Our findings reveal that even advanced models (e.g., GPT-4V and LLaMA-3) struggle with tasks that are relatively simple for humans. This highlights a crucial gap in current models and underscores the importance of developing more capable foundation models and more effective GUI agent frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Compared to this, editing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) faces extra challenges from diverse data modalities and complicated model components, and data for LVLMs editing are limited. The existing LVLM editing benchmark, which comprises three metrics (Reliability, Locality, and Generality), falls short in the quality of synthesized evaluation images and cannot assess whether models apply edited knowledge in relevant content. Therefore, we employ more reliable data collection methods to construct a new Large $\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage Model $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{B}$enchmark, $\textbf{VLKEB}$, and extend the Portability metric for more comprehensive evaluation. Leveraging a multi-modal knowledge graph, our image data are bound with knowledge entities. This can be further used to extract entity-related knowledge, which constitutes the base of editing data. We conduct experiments of different editing methods on five LVLMs, and thoroughly analyze how do they impact the models. The results reveal strengths and deficiencies of these methods and hopefully provide insights for future research.

The black-box design hinders the interpretability of visual-language models, especially regarding more complex reasoning tasks. To explore the interaction process between image and text in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce the information flow method to visualize the interaction mechanism. By analyzing the dynamic flow of the information flow, we find that the information flow appears to converge in the shallow layer. Further investigation revealed a redundancy of the image token in the shallow layer. Consequently, a truncation strategy was introduced to aggregate image tokens within these shallow layers. This approach has been validated through experiments across multiple models, yielding consistent improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility.

VLMs are shown to be able to perform complex visual reasoning and scene understanding tasks, which makes them regarded as a potential universal solution for general robotics problems such as manipulation and navigation. However, previous VLMs for robotics such as RT-1, RT-2, and ManipLLM have focused on directly learning robot-centric actions. Such approaches require collecting a significant amount of robot interaction data, which is extremely costly in the real world. Thus, we propose A3VLM, an object-centric, actionable, articulation-aware vision language model. A3VLM focuses on the articulation structure and action affordances of objects. Its representation is robot-agnostic and can be translated into robot actions using simple action primitives. Extensive experiments in both simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of A3VLM. We release our code and other materials at https://github.com/changhaonan/A3VLM.</p></details> |  |

These models rely on predefined textual descriptions, referred to as concepts, to inform their decision-making process and offer more accurate reasoning. As a result, the selection of concepts used in the model is of utmost significance. This study proposes \underline{\textbf{C}}onceptual \underline{\textbf{L}}earning via \underline{\textbf{E}}mbedding \underline{\textbf{A}}pproximations for \underline{\textbf{R}}einforcing Interpretability and Transparency, abbreviated as CLEAR, a framework for constructing a CBM for image classification. Using score matching and Langevin sampling, we approximate the embedding of concepts within the latent space of a vision-language model (VLM) by learning the scores associated with the joint distribution of images and concepts. A concept selection process is then employed to optimize the similarity between the learned embeddings and the predefined ones. The derived bottleneck offers insights into the CBM's decision-making process, enabling more comprehensive interpretations. Our approach was evaluated through extensive experiments and achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

These egocentric foundation models commonly use the transformer architecture. The memory footprint of these models during pretraining can be substantial. Therefore, we pretrain SViTT-Ego, the first sparse egocentric video-text transformer model integrating edge and node sparsification. We pretrain on the EgoClip dataset and incorporate the egocentric-friendly objective EgoNCE, instead of the frequently used InfoNCE. Most notably, SViTT-Ego obtains a +2.8% gain on EgoMCQ (intra-video) accuracy compared to LAVILA large, with no additional data augmentation techniques other than standard image augmentations, yet pretrainable on memory-limited devices.</p></details> |  |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 large vision-language models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose an innovative unified framework, which integrates rationales, actions, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+26.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +20.5% mIoU on MS COCO, +3.1% mIoU on COCO Stuff and +3.0% mIoU on ADE20K).

However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p></details> |  |

However, when deploying a vision-language system with low tolerance for inaccurate predictions, selective prediction may be over-cautious and abstain too frequently, even on many correct predictions. We introduce ReCoVERR, an inference-time algorithm to reduce the over-abstention of a selective vision-language system without increasing the error rate of the system's predictions. When the VLM makes a low-confidence prediction, instead of abstaining ReCoVERR tries to find relevant clues in the image that provide additional evidence for the prediction. ReCoVERR uses an LLM to pose related questions to the VLM, collects high-confidence evidences, and if enough evidence confirms the prediction the system makes a prediction instead of abstaining. ReCoVERR enables three VLMs (BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5) to answer up to 20% more questions on the VQAv2 and A-OKVQA tasks without decreasing system accuracy, thus improving overall system reliability.

Prior studies demonstrate that semantically aligning and enriching textual descriptions of these pairs can significantly enhance model training across various vision-language tasks, particularly text-to-image generation. However, large-scale investigations in this area remain predominantly closed-source. Our paper aims to bridge this community effort, leveraging the powerful and \textit{open-sourced} LLaMA-3, a GPT-4 level LLM. Our recaptioning pipeline is simple: first, we fine-tune a LLaMA-3-8B powered LLaVA-1.5 and then employ it to recaption 1.3 billion images from the DataComp-1B dataset. Our empirical results confirm that this enhanced dataset, Recap-DataComp-1B, offers substantial benefits in training advanced vision-language models.

Without requiring explicit commands by humans, AToM-Bot proactively generates and follows feasible tasks to improve general human well-being. When around humans, AToM-Bot first detects current human needs based on inferred human states and observations of the surrounding environment. It then generates tasks to fulfill these needs, taking into account its embodied constraints. We designed 16 daily life scenarios spanning 4 common scenes and tasked the same visual stimulus to 59 human subjects and our robot. We used the similarity between human open-ended answers and robot output, and the human satisfaction scores to metric robot performance. AToM-Bot received high human evaluations in need detection (6.42/7, 91.7%), embodied solution (6.15/7, 87.8%) and task execution (6.17/7, 88.1%). We show that AToM-Bot excels in generating and executing feasible plans to fulfill unspoken human needs. Videos and code are available at https://affective-tom-bot.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods are still far from practical usage. First, prior works focus narrowly on specific sub-tasks or settings, which do not align with diverse real-world applications. Second, their performance is sub-optimal due to limitations in dataset coverage, scale, and quality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Depicted image Quality Assessment in the Wild (DepictQA-Wild). Our method includes a multi-functional IQA task paradigm that encompasses both assessment and comparison tasks, brief and detailed responses, full-reference and non-reference scenarios. We introduce a ground-truth-informed dataset construction approach to enhance data quality, and scale up the dataset to 495K under the brief-detail joint framework. Consequently, we construct a comprehensive, large-scale, and high-quality dataset, named DQ-495K. We also retain image resolution during training to better handle resolution-related quality issues, and estimate a confidence score that is helpful to filter out low-quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that DepictQA-Wild significantly outperforms traditional score-based methods, prior VLM-based IQA models, and proprietary GPT-4V in distortion identification, instant rating, and reasoning tasks. Our advantages are further confirmed by real-world applications including assessing the web-downloaded images and ranking model-processed images.

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs), comprising a visual encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) decoder, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in such reasoning tasks. This prompts a crucial question: have VLMs effectively tackled the CR challenge? We conjecture that existing CR benchmarks may not adequately push the boundaries of modern VLMs due to the reliance on an LLM-only negative text generation pipeline. Consequently, the negatives produced either appear as outliers from the natural language distribution learned by VLMs' LLM decoders or as improbable within the corresponding image context. To address these limitations, we introduce ConMe -- a compositional reasoning benchmark and a novel data generation pipeline leveraging VLMs to produce `hard CR Q&A'. Through a new concept of VLMs conversing with each other to collaboratively expose their weaknesses, our pipeline autonomously generates, evaluates, and selects challenging compositional reasoning questions, establishing a robust CR benchmark, also subsequently validated manually. Our benchmark provokes a noteworthy, up to 33%, decrease in CR performance compared to preceding benchmarks, reinstating the CR challenge even for state-of-the-art VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

This paper addresses the challenge by leveraging the visual commonalities between images and videos to efficiently evolve image-LVLMs into video-LVLMs. We present a cost-effective video-LVLM that enhances model architecture, introduces innovative training strategies, and identifies the most effective types of video instruction data. Our innovative weighted token sampler significantly compresses the visual token numbers of each video frame, effectively cutting computational expenses. We also find that judiciously using just 10% of the video data, compared to prior video-LVLMs, yields impressive results during various training phases. Moreover, we delve into the influence of video instruction data in limited-resource settings, highlighting the significance of incorporating video training data that emphasizes temporal understanding to enhance model performance. The resulting Fewer Tokens and Fewer Videos LVLM (FTFV-LVLM) exhibits exceptional performance across video and image benchmarks, validating our model's design and training approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, to solve a new task, zero-shot transfer still necessitates human guidance to define visual categories that appear in the data. Here, we show that fully unsupervised transfer emerges when searching for the labeling of a dataset that induces maximal margin classifiers in representation spaces of different foundation models. We present TURTLE, a fully unsupervised method that effectively employs this guiding principle to uncover the underlying labeling of a downstream dataset without any supervision and task-specific representation learning. We evaluate TURTLE on a diverse benchmark suite of 26 datasets and show that it achieves new state-of-the-art unsupervised performance. Furthermore, TURTLE, although being fully unsupervised, outperforms zero-shot transfer baselines on a wide range of datasets. In particular, TURTLE matches the average performance of CLIP zero-shot on 26 datasets by employing the same representation space, spanning a wide range of architectures and model sizes. By guiding the search for the underlying labeling using the representation spaces of two foundation models, TURTLE surpasses zero-shot transfer and unsupervised prompt tuning baselines, demonstrating the surprising power and effectiveness of unsupervised transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[FaceGPT: Self-supervised Learning to Chat about 3D Human Faces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07163v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FaceGPT, a self-supervised learning framework for Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to reason about 3D human faces from images and text. Typical 3D face reconstruction methods are specialized algorithms that lack semantic reasoning capabilities. FaceGPT overcomes this limitation by embedding the parameters of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM) into the token space of a VLM, enabling the generation of 3D faces from both textual and visual inputs. FaceGPT is trained in a self-supervised manner as a model-based autoencoder from in-the-wild images. In particular, the hidden state of LLM is projected into 3DMM parameters and subsequently rendered as 2D face image to guide the self-supervised learning process via image-based reconstruction. Without relying on expensive 3D annotations of human faces, FaceGPT obtains a detailed understanding about 3D human faces, while preserving the capacity to understand general user instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that FaceGPT not only achieves high-quality 3D face reconstructions but also retains the ability for general-purpose visual instruction following. Furthermore, FaceGPT learns fully self-supervised to generate 3D faces based on complex textual inputs, which opens a new direction in human face analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object retrieval with simple (bare) queries but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene spatial graph representation with metric edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to form 3D objects, an advanced raycasting algorithm to project them to 2D, and a vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On Replica and ScanNet datasets, we show that the designed method accurately constructs 3D object-centric maps. We have demonstrated that their quality takes a leading place for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation against other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On Sr3D and Nr3D benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling retrieving objects by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Considering our design solutions, we achieved a processing speed approximately x3 times faster than the closest analog. This promising performance enables our approach for usage in applied intelligent robotics projects. We make the code publicly available at linukc.github.io/bbq/.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Effectiveness Assessment of Recent Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04306v4)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) represents a remarkable advance in the quest for artificial general intelligence. However, the model's effectiveness in both specialized and general tasks warrants further investigation. This paper endeavors to evaluate the competency of popular LVLMs in specialized and general tasks, respectively, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of these novel models. To gauge their effectiveness in specialized tasks, we employ six challenging tasks in three different application scenarios: natural, healthcare, and industrial. These six tasks include salient/camouflaged/transparent object detection, as well as polyp detection, skin lesion detection, and industrial anomaly detection. We examine the performance of three recent open-source LVLMs, including MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA-1.5, and Shikra, on both visual recognition and localization in these tasks. Moreover, we conduct empirical investigations utilizing the aforementioned LVLMs together with GPT-4V, assessing their multi-modal understanding capabilities in general tasks including object counting, absurd question answering, affordance reasoning, attribute recognition, and spatial relation reasoning. Our investigations reveal that these LVLMs demonstrate limited proficiency not only in specialized tasks but also in general tasks. We delve deep into this inadequacy and uncover several potential factors, including limited cognition in specialized tasks, object hallucination, text-to-image interference, and decreased robustness in complex problems. We hope that this study can provide useful insights for the future development of LVLMs, helping researchers improve LVLMs for both general and specialized applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Visual Intelligence</p></details> |

Unlike existing approaches that rely on masks, boxes, or category labels, we propose UVIS, a novel Unsupervised Video Instance Segmentation (UVIS) framework that can perform video instance segmentation without any video annotations or dense label-based pretraining. Our key insight comes from leveraging the dense shape prior from the self-supervised vision foundation model DINO and the openset recognition ability from the image-caption supervised vision-language model CLIP. Our UVIS framework consists of three essential steps: frame-level pseudo-label generation, transformer-based VIS model training, and query-based tracking. To improve the quality of VIS predictions in the unsupervised setup, we introduce a dual-memory design. This design includes a semantic memory bank for generating accurate pseudo-labels and a tracking memory bank for maintaining temporal consistency in object tracks. We evaluate our approach on three standard VIS benchmarks, namely YoutubeVIS-2019, YoutubeVIS-2021, and Occluded VIS. Our UVIS achieves 21.1 AP on YoutubeVIS-2019 without any video annotations or dense pretraining, demonstrating the potential of our unsupervised VIS framework.</p></details> | CVPR2024 Workshop |

Given the current radiologist shortage, there is a large impetus to use artificial intelligence to alleviate the burden of interpreting these complex imaging studies. Prior state-of-the-art approaches for automated medical image interpretation leverage vision language models (VLMs). However, current medical VLMs are generally limited to 2D images and short reports, and do not leverage electronic health record (EHR) data for supervision. We introduce Merlin - a 3D VLM that we train using paired CT scans (6+ million images from 15,331 CTs), EHR diagnosis codes (1.8+ million codes), and radiology reports (6+ million tokens). We evaluate Merlin on 6 task types and 752 individual tasks. The non-adapted (off-the-shelf) tasks include zero-shot findings classification (31 findings), phenotype classification (692 phenotypes), and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval (image to findings and image to impressions), while model adapted tasks include 5-year disease prediction (6 diseases), radiology report generation, and 3D semantic segmentation (20 organs). We perform internal validation on a test set of 5,137 CTs, and external validation on 7,000 clinical CTs and on two public CT datasets (VerSe, TotalSegmentator). Beyond these clinically-relevant evaluations, we assess the efficacy of various network architectures and training strategies to depict that Merlin has favorable performance to existing task-specific baselines. We derive data scaling laws to empirically assess training data needs for requisite downstream task performance. Furthermore, unlike conventional VLMs that require hundreds of GPUs for training, we perform all training on a single GPU.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

Unlike current benchmarks that often focus on fact-based memorization and simple reasoning tasks without theoretical grounding, we collect multiple-choice samples based on picture stories that reflect different levels of comprehension, as laid out in Bloom's Taxonomy, a classic framework for learning assessment widely adopted in education research. Our data maps to a novel hierarchical graph representation which enables automatic data augmentation and novel measures characterizing model consistency. We perform graded evaluation and reliability analysis on recent multi-modal models. In comparison to low-level tasks, we observe decreased performance on tasks requiring advanced comprehension and cognitive skills with up to 38.0\% drop in VQA accuracy. In comparison to earlier models, GPT-4V demonstrates improved accuracy over all comprehension levels and shows a tendency of bypassing visual inputs especially for higher-level tasks. Current models also show consistency patterns misaligned with human comprehension in various scenarios, demonstrating the need for improvement based on theoretically-grounded criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL Findings (2024).

| **[Direct Preference Optimization for Suppressing Hallucinated Prior Exams in Radiology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06496v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative vision-language models (VLMs) have exciting potential implications for AI in radiology, yet VLMs are also known to produce hallucinations, nonsensical text, and other unwanted behaviors that can waste clinicians' time and cause patient harm. Drawing on recent work on direct preference optimization (DPO), we propose a simple method for modifying the behavior of pretrained VLMs performing radiology report generation by suppressing unwanted types of generations. We apply our method to the prevention of hallucinations of prior exams, addressing a long-established problem behavior in models performing chest X-ray report generation. Across our experiments, we find that DPO fine-tuning achieves a 3.2-4.8x reduction in lines hallucinating prior exams while maintaining model performance on clinical accuracy metrics. Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work to apply DPO to medical VLMs, providing a data- and compute- efficient way to suppress problem behaviors while maintaining overall clinical accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[VCR: Visual Caption Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06462v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |

We evaluate the Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 5 tasks related to three foundational network science concepts: identifying nodes of maximal degree on a rendered graph, identifying whether signed triads are balanced or unbalanced, and counting components. The tasks are structured to be easy for a human who understands the underlying graph theoretic concepts, and can all be solved by counting the appropriate elements in graphs. We find that while GPT-4 consistently outperforms LLaVa, both models struggle with every visual network analysis task we propose. We publicly release the first benchmark for the evaluation of VLMs on foundational VNA tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We introduce HALC, a novel decoding algorithm designed to mitigate OH in LVLMs. HALC leverages distinct fine-grained optimal visual information in vision-language tasks and operates on both local and global contexts simultaneously. Specifically, HALC integrates a robust auto-focal grounding mechanism (locally) to correct hallucinated tokens on the fly, and a specialized beam search algorithm (globally) to significantly reduce OH while preserving text generation quality. Additionally, HALC can be integrated into any LVLMs as a plug-and-play module without extra training. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HALC in reducing OH, outperforming state-of-the-arts across four benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML camera-ready version.

| **[Data Augmentation in Earth Observation: A Diffusion Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06218v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) imagery poses a significant challenge, despite its critical role in enabling precise analysis and informed decision-making across various sectors. This scarcity is primarily due to atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage, which complicates the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Data augmentation, a widely used technique in AI that involves generating additional data mainly through parameterized image transformations, has been employed to increase the volume and diversity of data. However, this method often falls short in generating sufficient diversity across key semantic axes, adversely affecting the accuracy of EO applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel four-stage approach aimed at improving the diversity of augmented data by integrating diffusion models. Our approach employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, harnesses general-purpose vision-language models for generating rich captions, fine-tunes an Earth Observation diffusion model, and iteratively augments data. We conducted extensive experiments using four different data augmentation techniques, and our approach consistently demonstrated improvements, outperforming the established augmentation methods, revealing its effectiveness in generating semantically rich and diverse EO images.</p></details> |  |

However, they fail to showcase their quantitative understanding of objects, and they lack good counting-aware representation. This paper conducts a reproducibility study of 'Teaching CLIP to Count to Ten' (Paiss et al., 2023), which presents a method to finetune a CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021) to improve zero-shot counting accuracy in an image while maintaining the performance for zero-shot classification by introducing a counting-contrastive loss term. We improve the model's performance on a smaller subset of their training data with lower computational resources. We verify these claims by reproducing their study with our own code.

However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/CARES.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the current VQA models use datasets that are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are typically Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, although these datasets often extend their linguistic range via translation or some other approaches, they usually keep images the same, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we construct CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark, designed to cover a rich set of languages and cultures, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. As a result, CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 28 countries on four continents, covering 26 languages with 11 scripts, providing a total of 9k questions. We then benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark can serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural capability and bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts toward increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models pre-trained on enormous amounts of data have shown remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot inference. However, their performance is restricted to the correctness of the target label's search space. In an open world, this target search space can be unknown or exceptionally large, which severely restricts the performance of such models. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework called ALGO - Action Learning with Grounded Object recognition that uses symbolic knowledge stored in large-scale knowledge bases to infer activities in egocentric videos with limited supervision using two steps. First, we propose a neuro-symbolic prompting approach that uses object-centric vision-language models as a noisy oracle to ground objects in the video through evidence-based reasoning. Second, driven by prior commonsense knowledge, we discover plausible activities through an energy-based symbolic pattern theory framework and learn to ground knowledge-based action (verb) concepts in the video. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (EPIC-Kitchens, GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze Plus) demonstrate its performance on open-world activity inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract of arXiv:2305.16602 for CVPR EgoVis Workshop</p></details> |

In this study, we investigate the explainable model development that can mimic the decision-making process of human experts by fusing the domain knowledge of explicit diagnostic criteria. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, Explicd, towards Explainable language-informed criteria-based diagnosis. Explicd initiates its process by querying domain knowledge from either large language models (LLMs) or human experts to establish diagnostic criteria across various concept axes (e.g., color, shape, texture, or specific patterns of diseases). By leveraging a pretrained vision-language model, Explicd injects these criteria into the embedding space as knowledge anchors, thereby facilitating the learning of corresponding visual concepts within medical images. The final diagnostic outcome is determined based on the similarity scores between the encoded visual concepts and the textual criteria embeddings. Through extensive evaluation of five medical image classification benchmarks, Explicd has demonstrated its inherent explainability and extends to improve classification performance compared to traditional black-box models.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 Early Accept</p></details> |

In this study, our goal is to address the challenges when fine-tuning vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) on generated datasets. Specifically, we aim to fine-tune vision-language models to a specific classification model without access to any real images, also known as name-only transfer. However, despite the high fidelity of generated images, we observed a significant performance degradation when fine-tuning the model using the generated datasets due to the domain gap between real and generated images. To overcome the domain gap, we provide two regularization methods for training and post-training, respectively. First, we leverage the domain-agnostic knowledge from the original pre-trained vision-language model by conducting the weight-space ensemble of the fine-tuned model on the generated dataset with the original pre-trained model at the post-training. Secondly, we reveal that fine-tuned models with high feature diversity score high performance in the real domain, which indicates that increasing feature diversity prevents learning the generated domain-specific knowledge. Thus, we encourage feature diversity by providing additional regularization at training time. Extensive experiments on various classification datasets and various text-to-image generation models demonstrated that our analysis and regularization techniques effectively mitigate the domain gap, which has long been overlooked, and enable us to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training with generated images.

The vision-language model Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown robust zero-shot classification ability in image-level open-vocabulary task. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder network, called CLIP-VIS, to adapt CLIP for open-vocabulary video instance segmentation. Our CLIP-VIS adopts frozen CLIP image encoder and introduces three modules, including class-agnostic mask generation, temporal topK-enhanced matching, and weighted open-vocabulary classification. Given a set of initial queries, class-agnostic mask generation employs a transformer decoder to predict query masks and corresponding object scores and mask IoU scores. Then, temporal topK-enhanced matching performs query matching across frames by using K mostly matched frames. Finally, weighted open-vocabulary classification first generates query visual features with mask pooling, and second performs weighted classification using object scores and mask IoU scores.Our CLIP-VIS does not require the annotations of instance categories and identities. The experiments are performed on various video instance segmentation datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, especially on novel categories. When using ConvNeXt-B as backbone, our CLIP-VIS achieves the AP and APn scores of 32.2% and 40.2% on validation set of LV-VIS dataset, which outperforms OV2Seg by 11.1% and 23.9% respectively. We will release the source code and models at https://github.com/zwq456/CLIP-VIS.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs. Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities. To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images. Specifically, we present LVLMs with identical open-ended text prompts while conditioning on images from different counterfactual sets, where each set contains images which are largely identical in their depiction of a common subject (e.g., a doctor), but vary only in terms of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race and gender). We comprehensively evaluate the text produced by different LVLMs under this counterfactual generation setting and find that social attributes such as race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in input images can significantly influence toxicity and the generation of competency-associated words.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2024 Responsible Generative AI (ReGenAI) Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Visual-Language Modality Alignment in Large Vision Language Models via Self-Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15973v3)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in various visual question-answering and reasoning tasks through vision instruction tuning on specific datasets. However, there is still significant room for improvement in the alignment between visual and language modalities. Previous methods to enhance this alignment typically require external models or data, heavily depending on their capabilities and quality, which inevitably sets an upper bound on performance. In this paper, we propose SIMA, a framework that enhances visual and language modality alignment through self-improvement, eliminating the needs for external models or data. SIMA leverages prompts from existing vision instruction tuning datasets to self-generate responses and employs an in-context self-critic mechanism to select response pairs for preference tuning. The key innovation is the introduction of three vision metrics during the in-context self-critic process, which can guide the LVLM in selecting responses that enhance image comprehension. Through experiments across 14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that SIMA not only improves model performance across all benchmarks but also achieves superior modality alignment, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

This methodology enriches vision-language models by leveraging extensive data without needing ground truth annotations. CPLIP involves constructing a pathology-specific dictionary, generating textual descriptions for images using language models, and retrieving relevant images for each text snippet via a pre-trained model. The model is then fine-tuned using a many-to-many contrastive learning method to align complex interrelated concepts across both modalities. Evaluated across multiple histopathology tasks, CPLIP shows notable improvements in zero-shot learning scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both interpretability and robustness and setting a higher benchmark for the application of vision-language models in the field. To encourage further research and replication, the code for CPLIP is available on GitHub at https://cplip.github.io/</p></details> |  |

However, when faced with prompts in different sizes of solution spaces, LVLMs fail to always give consistent answers regarding the same knowledge point. This inconsistency of answers between different solution spaces is prevalent in LVLMs and erodes trust. To this end, we provide a multi-modal benchmark ConBench, to intuitively analyze how LVLMs perform when the solution space of a prompt revolves around a knowledge point. Based on the ConBench tool, we are the first to reveal the tapestry and get the following findings: (1) In the discriminate realm, the larger the solution space of the prompt, the lower the accuracy of the answers. (2) Establish the relationship between the discriminative and generative realms: the accuracy of the discriminative question type exhibits a strong positive correlation with its Consistency with the caption. (3) Compared to open-source models, closed-source models exhibit a pronounced bias advantage in terms of Consistency. Eventually, we ameliorate the consistency of LVLMs by trigger-based diagnostic refinement, indirectly improving the performance of their caption. We hope this paper will accelerate the research community in better evaluating their models and encourage future advancements in the consistency domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project is available at https://github.com/foundation-multimodal-models/ConBench</p></details> |

The current RVOS methods typically use independently pre-trained vision and language models as backbones, resulting in a significant domain gap between video and text. In cross-modal feature interaction, text features are only used as query initialization and do not fully utilize important information in the text. In this work, we propose using frozen pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) as backbones, with a specific emphasis on enhancing cross-modal feature interaction. Firstly, we use frozen convolutional CLIP backbone to generate feature-aligned vision and text features, alleviating the issue of domain gap and reducing training costs. Secondly, we add more cross-modal feature fusion in the pipeline to enhance the utilization of multi-modal information. Furthermore, we propose a novel video query initialization method to generate higher quality video queries. Without bells and whistles, our method achieved 51.5 J&F on the MeViS test set and ranked 3rd place for MeViS Track in CVPR 2024 PVUW workshop: Motion Expression guided Video Segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Existing works have proposed different methods to embed category cues into the model, \eg, through few-shot fine-tuning, providing category names or textual descriptions to Vision-Language Models. Fine-tuning is time-consuming and degrades the generalization capability. Textual descriptions could be ambiguous and fail to depict visual details. This paper tackles open-vocabulary recognition from a different perspective by referring to multi-modal clues composed of textual descriptions and exemplar images. Our method, named OVMR, adopts two innovative components to pursue a more robust category cues embedding. A multi-modal classifier is first generated by dynamically complementing textual descriptions with image exemplars. A preference-based refinement module is hence applied to fuse uni-modal and multi-modal classifiers, with the aim to alleviate issues of low-quality exemplar images or textual descriptions. The proposed OVMR is a plug-and-play module, and works well with exemplar images randomly crawled from the Internet. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the promising performance of OVMR, \eg, it outperforms existing methods across various scenarios and setups.

| **[Matryoshka Query Transformer for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19315v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically encode an image into a fixed number of visual tokens (e.g., 576) and process these tokens with a language model. Despite their strong performance, LVLMs face challenges in adapting to varying computational constraints. This raises the question: can we achieve flexibility in the number of visual tokens to suit different tasks and computational resources? We answer this with an emphatic yes. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, we introduce the Matryoshka Query Transformer (MQT), capable of encoding an image into m visual tokens during inference, where m can be any number up to a predefined maximum. This is achieved by employing a query transformer with M latent query tokens to compress the visual embeddings. During each training step, we randomly select m <= M latent query tokens and train the model using only these first m tokens, discarding the rest. Combining MQT with LLaVA, we train a single model once, and flexibly and drastically reduce the number of inference-time visual tokens while maintaining similar or better performance compared to training independent models for each number of tokens. Our model, MQT-LLAVA, matches LLaVA-1.5 performance across 11 benchmarks using a maximum of 256 tokens instead of LLaVA's fixed 576. Reducing to 16 tokens (8x less TFLOPs) only sacrifices the performance by 2.4 points on MMBench. On certain tasks such as ScienceQA and MMMU, we can even go down to only 2 visual tokens with performance drops of just 3% and 6% each. Our exploration of the trade-off between the accuracy and computational cost brought about by the number of visual tokens facilitates future research to achieve the best of both worlds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this work, we present SpatialPIN, a framework designed to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs through prompting and interacting with priors from multiple 3D foundation models in a zero-shot, training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our spatial reasoning-imbued VLM performs well on various forms of spatial VQA and can extend to help in various downstream robotics tasks such as pick and stack and trajectory planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dannymcy.github.io/zeroshot_task_hallucination/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient 3D-Aware Facial Image Editing via Attribute-Specific Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04413v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing upon StyleGAN's expressivity and disentangled latent space, existing 2D approaches employ textual prompting to edit facial images with different attributes. In contrast, 3D-aware approaches that generate faces at different target poses require attribute-specific classifiers, learning separate model weights for each attribute, and are not scalable for novel attributes. In this work, we propose an efficient, plug-and-play, 3D-aware face editing framework based on attribute-specific prompt learning, enabling the generation of facial images with controllable attributes across various target poses. To this end, we introduce a text-driven learnable style token-based latent attribute editor (LAE). The LAE harnesses a pre-trained vision-language model to find text-guided attribute-specific editing direction in the latent space of any pre-trained 3D-aware GAN. It utilizes learnable style tokens and style mappers to learn and transform this editing direction to 3D latent space. To train LAE with multiple attributes, we use directional contrastive loss and style token loss. Furthermore, to ensure view consistency and identity preservation across different poses and attributes, we employ several 3D-aware identity and pose preservation losses. Our experiments show that our proposed framework generates high-quality images with 3D awareness and view consistency while maintaining attribute-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on different facial attributes, including hair color and style, expression, and others.

However, the existing retrievers are mostly text-oriented, which lack the capability to process visual information. Despite the presence of vision-language models like CLIP, the current methods are severely limited in representing the text-only and image-only data. In this work, we present a new embedding model VISTA for universal multi-modal retrieval. Our work brings forth threefold technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a flexible architecture which extends a powerful text encoder with the image understanding capability by introducing visual token embeddings. Secondly, we develop two data generation strategies, which bring high-quality composed image-text to facilitate the training of the embedding model. Thirdly, we introduce a multi-stage training algorithm, which first aligns the visual token embedding with the text encoder using massive weakly labeled data, and then develops multi-modal representation capability using the generated composed image-text data. In our experiments, VISTA achieves superior performances across a variety of multi-modal retrieval tasks in both zero-shot and supervised settings.

Specifically, we use this tiny \textbf{Lever-LM} to configure effective in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences to improve the In-Context Learinng (ICL) performance of LVLMs. Previous studies show that diverse ICD configurations like the selection and ordering of the demonstrations heavily affect the ICL performance, highlighting the significance of configuring effective ICD sequences. Motivated by this and by re-considering the the process of configuring ICD sequence, we find this is a mirror process of human sentence composition and further assume that effective ICD configurations may contain internal statistical patterns that can be captured by Lever-LM. Then a dataset with effective ICD sequences is constructed to train Lever-LM. After training, given novel queries, new ICD sequences are configured by the trained Lever-LM to solve vision-language tasks through ICL. Experiments show that these ICD sequences can improve the ICL performance of two LVLMs compared with some strong baselines in Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning, validating that Lever-LM can really capture the statistical patterns for levering LVLMs.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Cascade-CLIP: Cascaded Vision-Language Embeddings Alignment for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00670v2)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, have been successfully applied to zero-shot semantic segmentation. Existing CLIP-based approaches primarily utilize visual features from the last layer to align with text embeddings, while they neglect the crucial information in intermediate layers that contain rich object details. However, we find that directly aggregating the multi-level visual features weakens the zero-shot ability for novel classes. The large differences between the visual features from different layers make these features hard to align well with the text embeddings. We resolve this problem by introducing a series of independent decoders to align the multi-level visual features with the text embeddings in a cascaded way, forming a novel but simple framework named Cascade-CLIP. Our Cascade-CLIP is flexible and can be easily applied to existing zero-shot semantic segmentation methods. Experimental results show that our simple Cascade-CLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance on segmentation benchmarks, like COCO-Stuff, Pascal-VOC, and Pascal-Context.

| **[Jailbreak Vision Language Models via Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04031v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of large vision language models (LVLMs), jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to bypass guardrails and uncover safety implications. Existing jailbreaks predominantly focus on the visual modality, perturbing solely visual inputs in the prompt for attacks. However, they fall short when confronted with aligned models that fuse visual and textual features simultaneously for generation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt Attack (BAP), which executes jailbreaks by optimizing textual and visual prompts cohesively. Initially, we adversarially embed universally harmful perturbations in an image, guided by a few-shot query-agnostic corpus (e.g., affirmative prefixes and negative inhibitions). This process ensures that image prompt LVLMs to respond positively to any harmful queries. Subsequently, leveraging the adversarial image, we optimize textual prompts with specific harmful intent. In particular, we utilize a large language model to analyze jailbreak failures and employ chain-of-thought reasoning to refine textual prompts through a feedback-iteration manner. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations on various datasets and LVLMs, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms other methods by large margins (+29.03% in attack success rate on average). Additionally, we showcase the potential of our attacks on black-box commercial LVLMs, such as Gemini and ChatGLM.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have focused on dedicated cue extraction methods, in this work we investigate the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for extracting a wide array of contextual cues to improve gaze following performance. We first evaluate various VLMs, prompting strategies, and in-context learning (ICL) techniques for zero-shot cue recognition performance. We then use these insights to extract contextual cues for gaze following, and investigate their impact when incorporated into a state of the art model for the task. Our analysis indicates that BLIP-2 is the overall top performing VLM and that ICL can improve performance. We also observe that VLMs are sensitive to the choice of the text prompt although ensembling over multiple text prompts can provide more robust performance. Additionally, we discover that using the entire image along with an ellipse drawn around the target person is the most effective strategy for visual prompting. For gaze following, incorporating the extracted cues results in better generalization performance, especially when considering a larger set of cues, highlighting the potential of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the GAZE Workshop at CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[VisLTR: Visualization-in-the-Loop Table Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03753v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table reasoning transforms user requirements into corresponding answers according to the provided table, which is often integrated with natural language interfaces for lay users to explore tabular data effortlessly. Recent research exploits large language models to facilitate table reasoning, by transforming vague user requirements into structured query languages (SQLs). However, these SQL-based approaches often overlook changes in data patterns, suffer from LLM drift, and limit exploration to only text queries. To this end, VisLTR is designed as a visualization-in-the-loop table reasoning framework that leverages visualizations as a proxy to provide concise data representations, capture interesting data patterns, and support cross-modal analysis. We describe VisLTR as a process consisting of four major modules: 1) visualization alignment that utilizes large vision-language models to align visualizations across various modalities, including chart, text, and sketch; 2) visualization referencing that decomposes a table into multifaceted visualization references that comprehensively represent the table; 3) visualization pruning that incorporates data and retrieval pruning to excise visualization references with poor information and enhance retrieval efficiency; and 4) visualization interaction that offers an interactive visual interface with multi-modal interactions for user-friendly table reasoning. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the alignment model in cross-modal visualization pairings. We further demonstrate applications of the framework on various table reasoning tasks such as table summarization and pattern detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

A comprehensive quantitative evaluation is necessary to identify and understand the extent of hallucinations in these models. However, existing benchmarks are often limited in scope, focusing mainly on object hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods struggle to effectively address the subtle semantic distinctions between model outputs and reference data, as well as the balance between hallucination and informativeness. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-dimensional benchmark covering objects, attributes, and relations, with challenging images selected based on associative biases. Moreover, we propose a large language model (LLM)-based two-stage evaluation framework that generalizes the popular CHAIR metric and incorporates both faithfulness and coverage into the evaluation. Experiments on 10 established LVLMs demonstrate that our evaluation metric is more comprehensive and better correlated with humans than existing work when evaluating on our challenging human-annotated benchmark dataset. Our work also highlights the critical balance between faithfulness and coverage of model outputs, and encourages future works to address hallucinations in LVLMs while keeping their outputs informative.</p></details> | ACL 2024 Findings |

Prior work has shown that these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the vision modality. These attacks can be leveraged to spread fake information or defraud users, and thus pose a significant risk, which makes the robustness of large multi-modal foundation models a pressing problem. The CLIP model, or one of its variants, is used as a frozen vision encoder in many large vision-language models (LVLMs), e.g. LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder, which yields robustness on all vision down-stream tasks (LVLMs, zero-shot classification) that rely on CLIP. In particular, we show that stealth-attacks on users of LVLMs by a malicious third party providing manipulated images are no longer possible once one replaces the original CLIP model with our robust one. No retraining or fine-tuning of the down-stream LVLMs is required. The code and robust models are available at https://github.com/chs20/RobustVLM</p></details> | ICML 2024 Oral |

However, their application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose to additionally use the text encoder to obtain the text embeddings corresponding to the MiniGPT-4-generated semantic descriptions. Thus, we use both the image and text embeddings for solving the image classification task.

However, in this paper, we empirically find that the finer descriptions tend to align more effectively with local areas of the query image rather than the whole image, and then we theoretically validate this finding. Thus, we present a method called weighted visual-text cross alignment (WCA). This method begins with a localized visual prompting technique, designed to identify local visual areas within the query image. The local visual areas are then cross-aligned with the finer descriptions by creating a similarity matrix using the pre-trained VLM. To determine how well a query image aligns with each category, we develop a score function based on the weighted similarities in this matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves zero-shot performance across various datasets, achieving results that are even comparable to few-shot learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 16 figures, published to ICML 2024</p></details> |

Recent work has investigated both vision and language modalities for physical reasoning; vision can reveal information about objects in the environment and language serves as an abstraction and communication medium for additional context. Although these works have demonstrated success on a variety of physical reasoning tasks, they are limited to physical properties that can be inferred from visual or language inputs.

In this work, we present a novel interactive application aimed towards understanding the internal mechanisms of large vision-language models. Our interface is designed to enhance the interpretability of the image patches, which are instrumental in generating an answer, and assess the efficacy of the language model in grounding its output in the image. With our application, a user can systematically investigate the model and uncover system limitations, paving the way for enhancements in system capabilities.

Arial photographs taken from small manned and unmanned aircraft can be available soon after a disaster and provide valuable information from multiple perspectives for situational awareness and damage assessment applications. However, emergency managers often face challenges finding the most relevant photos among the tens of thousands that may be taken after an incident. While ML-based solutions could enable more effective use of aerial photographs, there is still a lack of training data for imagery of this type from multiple perspectives and for multiple hazard types. To address this, we present the LADI v2 (Low Altitude Disaster Imagery version 2) dataset, a curated set of about 10,000 disaster images captured in the United States by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in response to federally-declared emergencies (2015-2023) and annotated for multi-label classification by trained CAP volunteers. We also provide two pretrained baseline classifiers and compare their performance to state-of-the-art vision-language models in multi-label classification. The data and code are released publicly to support the development of computer vision models for emergency management research and applications.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, spatial reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs remain unattested and underexplored. In this work, we thus study their capability to understand and reason over spatial relations from the top view. The focus on top view also enables controlled evaluations at different granularity of spatial reasoning; we clearly disentangle different abilities (e.g., recognizing particular objects versus understanding their relative positions). We introduce the TopViewRS (Top-View Reasoning in Space) dataset, consisting of 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either realistic or semantic top-view map as visual input. We then use it to study and evaluate VLMs across 4 perception and reasoning tasks with different levels of complexity. Evaluation of 10 representative open- and closed-source VLMs reveals the gap of more than 50% compared to average human performance, and it is even lower than the random baseline in some cases. Although additional experiments show that Chain-of-Thought reasoning can boost model capabilities by 5.82% on average, the overall performance of VLMs remains limited. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced model capability in top-view spatial reasoning and set a foundation for further research towards human-level proficiency of VLMs in real-world multimodal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables (21 pages, 4 figures, 15 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[On the Intrinsic Self-Correction Capability of LLMs: Uncertainty and Latent Concept](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02378v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When these instructions lack specific details about the issues in the response, this is referred to as leveraging the intrinsic self-correction capability. The empirical success of self-correction can be found in various applications, e.g., text detoxification and social bias mitigation. However, leveraging this self-correction capability may not always be effective, as it has the potential to revise an initially correct response into an incorrect one. In this paper, we endeavor to understand how and why leveraging the self-correction capability is effective. We identify that appropriate instructions can guide LLMs to a convergence state, wherein additional self-correction steps do not yield further performance improvements. We empirically demonstrate that model uncertainty and activated latent concepts jointly characterize the effectiveness of self-correction. Furthermore, we provide a mathematical formulation indicating that the activated latent concept drives the convergence of the model uncertainty and self-correction performance. Our analysis can also be generalized to the self-correction behaviors observed in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Moreover, we highlight that task-agnostic debiasing can benefit from our principle in terms of selecting effective fine-tuning samples. Such initial success demonstrates the potential extensibility for better instruction tuning and safety alignment.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |

Therefore, they are widely used for driver assistance functions, and are expected to be crucial for the success of autonomous driving in the future. In many perception tasks only pre-processed radar point clouds are considered. In contrast, radar spectra are a raw form of radar measurements and contain more information than radar point clouds. However, radar spectra are rather difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to explore the semantic information contained in spectra in the context of automated driving, thereby moving towards better interpretability of radar spectra. To this end, we create a radar spectra-language model, allowing us to query radar spectra measurements for the presence of scene elements using free text. We overcome the scarcity of radar spectra data by matching the embedding space of an existing vision-language model (VLM). Finally, we explore the benefit of the learned representation for scene parsing, and obtain improvements in free space segmentation and object detection merely by injecting the spectra embedding into a baseline model.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the efficient and effective understanding of text-rich images is a crucial litmus test for the capability of Vision-Language Models. We have crafted an efficient vision-language model, StrucTexTv3, tailored to tackle various intelligent tasks for text-rich images. The significant design of StrucTexTv3 is presented in the following aspects: Firstly, we adopt a combination of an effective multi-scale reduced visual transformer and a multi-granularity token sampler (MG-Sampler) as a visual token generator, successfully solving the challenges of high-resolution input and complex representation learning for text-rich images. Secondly, we enhance the perception and comprehension abilities of StrucTexTv3 through instruction learning, seamlessly integrating various text-oriented tasks into a unified framework. Thirdly, we have curated a comprehensive collection of high-quality text-rich images, abbreviated as TIM-30M, encompassing diverse scenarios like incidental scenes, office documents, web pages, and screenshots, thereby improving the robustness of our model. Our method achieved SOTA results in text-rich image perception tasks, and significantly improved performance in comprehension tasks. Among multimodal models with LLM decoder of approximately 1.8B parameters, it stands out as a leader, which also makes the deployment of edge devices feasible. In summary, the StrucTexTv3 model, featuring efficient structural design, outstanding performance, and broad adaptability, offers robust support for diverse intelligent application tasks involving text-rich images, thus exhibiting immense potential for widespread application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable and Principled Efficiency for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07448v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success of pre-trained foundation vision-language models makes Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) possible. Despite the promising performance, this approach introduces heavy computational overheads for two challenges: 1) large model sizes of the backbone; 2) expensive costs during the fine-tuning. These challenges hinder this OVS strategy from being widely applicable and affordable in real-world scenarios. Although traditional methods such as model compression and efficient fine-tuning can address these challenges, they often rely on heuristics. This means that their solutions cannot be easily transferred and necessitate re-training on different models, which comes at a cost. In the context of efficient OVS, we target achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than prior OVS works based on large vision-language foundation models, by utilizing smaller models that incur lower training costs. The core strategy is to make our efficiency principled and thus seamlessly transferable from one OVS framework to others without further customization. Comprehensive experiments on diverse OVS benchmarks demonstrate our superior trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computation costs over previous works.

| **[HPE-CogVLM: New Head Pose Grounding Task Exploration on Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01914v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Head pose estimation (HPE) task requires a sophisticated understanding of 3D spatial relationships and precise numerical output of yaw, pitch, and roll Euler angles. Previous HPE studies are mainly based on Non-large language models (Non-LLMs), which rely on close-up human heads cropped from the full image as inputs and lack robustness in real-world scenario. In this paper, we present a novel framework to enhance the HPE prediction task by leveraging the visual grounding capability of CogVLM. CogVLM is a vision language model (VLM) with grounding capability of predicting object bounding boxes (BBoxes), which enables HPE training and prediction using full image information input. To integrate the HPE task into the VLM, we first cop with the catastrophic forgetting problem in large language models (LLMs) by investigating the rehearsal ratio in the data rehearsal method. Then, we propose and validate a LoRA layer-based model merging method, which keeps the integrity of parameters, to enhance the HPE performance in the framework. The results show our HPE-CogVLM achieves a 31.5\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error for HPE prediction over the current Non-LLM based state-of-the-art in cross-dataset evaluation. Furthermore, we compare our LoRA layer-based model merging method with LoRA fine-tuning only and other merging methods in CogVLM. The results demonstrate our framework outperforms them in all HPE metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Vision-Language Models with Transduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01837v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transduction is a powerful paradigm that leverages the structure of unlabeled data to boost predictive accuracy. We present TransCLIP, a novel and computationally efficient transductive approach designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). TransCLIP is applicable as a plug-and-play module on top of popular inductive zero- and few-shot models, consistently improving their performances. Our new objective function can be viewed as a regularized maximum-likelihood estimation, constrained by a KL divergence penalty that integrates the text-encoder knowledge and guides the transductive learning process. We further derive an iterative Block Majorize-Minimize (BMM) procedure for optimizing our objective, with guaranteed convergence and decoupled sample-assignment updates, yielding computationally efficient transduction for large-scale datasets. We report comprehensive evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies that demonstrate: (i) Transduction can greatly enhance the generalization capabilities of inductive pretrained zero- and few-shot VLMs; (ii) TransCLIP substantially outperforms standard transductive few-shot learning methods relying solely on vision features, notably due to the KL-based language constraint.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of vision language models has sparked an increase in demands for sharing reports linked to CheXpert images, along with a growing interest among AI fairness researchers in obtaining demographic data. To address this, CheXpert Plus serves as a new collection of radiology data sources, made publicly available to enhance the scaling, performance, robustness, and fairness of models for all subsequent machine learning tasks in the field of radiology. CheXpert Plus is the largest text dataset publicly released in radiology, with a total of 36 million text tokens, including 13 million impression tokens. To the best of our knowledge, it represents the largest text de-identification effort in radiology, with almost 1 million PHI spans anonymized. It is only the second time that a large-scale English paired dataset has been released in radiology, thereby enabling, for the first time, cross-institution training at scale. All reports are paired with high-quality images in DICOM format, along with numerous image and patient metadata covering various clinical and socio-economic groups, as well as many pathology labels and RadGraph annotations. We hope this dataset will boost research for AI models that can further assist radiologists and help improve medical care.

However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks. Code, dataset, and benchmark will be released at https://www.anjiecheng.me/SpatialRGPT</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.anjiecheng.me/SpatialRGPT</p></details> |
| **[SLANT: Spurious Logo ANalysis Toolkit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01449v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online content is filled with logos, from ads and social media posts to website branding and product placements. Consequently, these logos are prevalent in the extensive web-scraped datasets used to pretrain Vision-Language Models, which are used for a wide array of tasks (content moderation, object classification). While these models have been shown to learn harmful correlations in various tasks, whether these correlations include logos remains understudied. Understanding this is especially important due to logos often being used by public-facing entities like brands and government agencies. To that end, we develop SLANT: A Spurious Logo ANalysis Toolkit. Our key finding is that some logos indeed lead to spurious incorrect predictions, for example, adding the Adidas logo to a photo of a person causes a model classify the person as greedy. SLANT contains a semi-automatic mechanism for mining such "spurious" logos. The mechanism consists of a comprehensive logo bank, CC12M-LogoBank, and an algorithm that searches the bank for logos that VLMs spuriously correlate with a user-provided downstream recognition target. We uncover various seemingly harmless logos that VL models correlate 1) with negative human adjectives 2) with the concept of `harmlessness'; causing models to misclassify harmful online content as harmless, and 3) with user-provided object concepts; causing lower recognition accuracy on ImageNet zero-shot classification. Furthermore, SLANT's logos can be seen as effective attacks against foundational models; an attacker could place a spurious logo on harmful content, causing the model to misclassify it as harmless. This threat is alarming considering the simplicity of logo attacks, increasing the attack surface of VL models. As a defense, we include in our Toolkit two effective mitigation strategies that seamlessly integrate with zero-shot inference of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ED-SAM: An Efficient Diffusion Sampling Approach to Domain Generalization in Vision-Language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01432v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-Language Foundation Model has recently shown outstanding performance in various perception learning tasks. The outstanding performance of the vision-language model mainly relies on large-scale pre-training datasets and different data augmentation techniques. However, the domain generalization problem of the vision-language foundation model needs to be addressed. This problem has limited the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model to unknown data distributions. In this paper, we introduce a new simple but efficient Diffusion Sampling approach to Domain Generalization (ED-SAM) to improve the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model. Our theoretical analysis in this work reveals the critical role and relation of the diffusion model to domain generalization in the vision-language foundation model. Then, based on the insightful analysis, we introduce a new simple yet effective Transport Transformation to diffusion sampling method. It can effectively generate adversarial samples to improve the generalizability of the foundation model against unknown data distributions. The experimental results on different scales of vision-language pre-training datasets, including CC3M, CC12M, and LAION400M, have consistently shown State-of-the-Art performance and scalability of the proposed ED-SAM approach compared to the other recent methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[EAGLE: Efficient Adaptive Geometry-based Learning in Cross-view Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01429v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been an efficient approach to transferring the semantic segmentation model across data distributions. Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy. The benchmark ComTQA has been open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance/ComTQA. The source code and model will be released later.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Despite the progress made in designing efficient fine-tuning methods, such methods require access to the model's parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes a \textbf{C}ollabo\textbf{ra}tive \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CraFT}) approach for fine-tuning black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules, a prompt generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm. Extensive experiments on few-shot classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about 12\% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing only 1.62\% compared to the white-box method.

Most existing zero-shot OOD detectors rely on ID class label-based prompts to guide CLIP in classifying ID images and rejecting OOD images. In this work we instead propose to leverage a large set of diverse auxiliary outlier class labels as pseudo OOD class text prompts to CLIP for enhancing zero-shot OOD detection, an approach we called Outlier Label Exposure (OLE). The key intuition is that ID images are expected to have lower similarity to these outlier class prompts than OOD images. One issue is that raw class labels often include noise labels, e.g., synonyms of ID labels, rendering raw OLE-based detection ineffective. To address this issue, we introduce an outlier prototype learning module that utilizes the prompt embeddings of the outlier labels to learn a small set of pivotal outlier prototypes for an embedding similarity-based OOD scoring. Additionally, the outlier classes and their prototypes can be loosely coupled with the ID classes, leading to an inseparable decision region between them. Thus, we also introduce an outlier label generation module that synthesizes our outlier prototypes and ID class embeddings to generate in-between outlier prototypes to further calibrate the detection in OLE. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments show that OLE substantially improves detection performance and achieves new state-of-the-art performance in large-scale OOD and hard OOD detection benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN2024, 8 pages</p></details> |

| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (1 expert). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures DISTS, FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-informed and wavelength-flexible data-driven photoacoustic oximetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14863v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significance: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) promises to measure spatially-resolved blood oxygen saturation, but suffers from a lack of accurate and robust spectral unmixing methods to deliver on this promise. Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM.

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images.

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), the induced acoustic pressure waves are measured by an array of detectors and used to reconstruct an image of the initial pressure distribution. A common challenge faced in PAT is that the measured acoustic waves can only be sparsely sampled. Reconstructing sparsely sampled data using standard methods results in severe artifacts that obscure information within the image. We propose a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture termed Fully Dense UNet (FD-UNet) for removing artifacts from 2D PAT images reconstructed from sparse data and compare the proposed CNN with the standard UNet in terms of reconstructed image quality.</p></details> |  |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptWizard: Task-Aware Agent-driven Prompt Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18369v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 |
| **[Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as an unnecessarily expanded training set, computational inefficiency from dumping the KV cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, we propose a new paradigm in fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation, called SimulMask. It utilizes a novel attention mask technique that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention connections under a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on three language pairs when averaged across four different latency regimes while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> |  |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models as Prompt Optimizers: An Analogical Analysis with Gradient-based Model Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17564v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic prompt optimization is an important approach to improving the performance of large language models (LLMs). Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6%-29.3% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We further show that the score function for tasks can be modified to better align with individual preferences. We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks.</p></details> | 58 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |

However, prompts often require some tuning to improve performance for deployment. Recent work has proposed automatic prompt optimization methods, but as prompt complexity and LLM strength increase, many prompt optimization techniques are no longer sufficient and a new approach is needed to optimize {\em meta prompt programs}. To address this, we introduce SAMMO, a framework for {\em compile-time} optimizations of metaprompt programs, which represent prompts as structured objects that allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Results highlight GPT4 APO's superior performance in standardizing prompt quality across clinical note sections. A human-in-the-loop approach shows that experts maintain content quality post-APO, with a preference for their own modifications, suggesting the value of expert customization.

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The project code is available at https://vlislab22.github.io/BrightDreamer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v2)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Multi-Role Capabilities of Large Language Models for Open-Domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05217v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has emerged as a pivotal research spotlight in information systems. Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v2)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to effectively instruct LLMs poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat fragmented optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the capacity of LLMs to produce responses of superior quality compared to baselines. Moreover, LangGPT has proven effective in guiding LLMs to generate high-quality prompts. We have built a community on LangGPT to facilitate the tuition and sharing of prompt design. We also analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a community user survey.</p></details> |  |

However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |

Contrast to previous model-oriented yet instruction-agnostic Automatic Prompt Optimization methodologies, yielding polished results for predefined target models while suffering rapid degradation with out-of-box models, we present Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). This approach is supported by our large-scale prompt preference dataset and employs a modular fine-tuning schema. The FIPO schema reimagines the optimization process into manageable modules, anchored by a meta prompt that dynamically adapts content. This allows for the flexible integration of the raw task instruction, the optional instruction response, and the optional ground truth to produce finely optimized task prompts. The FIPO preference dataset is meticulously constructed using the optimal and suboptimal LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-verification by human experts and analytical models. Applying the insights from the data with Tulu2 models and fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO schema across five public benchmarks.

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms.

Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |

Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/Eladlev/AutoPrompt}{here}$.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the phrasing of the task prompt, leading to research on automatic prompt optimization using labeled task data. We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Main |

Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Good Prompt Optimizers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02101v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Automatic Prompt Optimization, which typically utilizes LLMs as Prompt Optimizers to self-reflect and refine prompts, has shown promising performance in recent studies. Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new "Automatic Behavior Optimization" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

In contrast to existing text-to-3D methods that often entail time-consuming per-prompt optimization and commonly output representations other than polygonal meshes, AToM directly generates high-quality textured meshes in less than 1 second with around 10 times reduction in the training cost, and generalizes to unseen prompts. Our key idea is a novel triplane-based text-to-mesh architecture with a two-stage amortized optimization strategy that ensures stable training and enables scalability. Through extensive experiments on various prompt benchmarks, AToM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art amortized approaches with over 4 times higher accuracy (in DF415 dataset) and produces more distinguishable and higher-quality 3D outputs. AToM demonstrates strong generalizability, offering finegrained 3D assets for unseen interpolated prompts without further optimization during inference, unlike per-prompt solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages with appendix and references.

However, dreaming has not been successfully applied to language models because the input space is discrete. We extend Greedy Coordinate Gradient, a method from the language model adversarial attack literature, to design the Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (EPO) algorithm. EPO optimizes the input prompt to simultaneously maximize the Pareto frontier between a chosen internal feature and prompt fluency, enabling fluent dreaming for language models. We demonstrate dreaming with neurons, output logits and arbitrary directions in activation space. We measure the fluency of the resulting prompts and compare language model dreaming with max-activating dataset examples. Critically, fluent dreaming allows automatically exploring the behavior of model internals in reaction to mildly out-of-distribution prompts. Code for running EPO is available at https://github.com/Confirm-Solutions/dreamy.

As the use of these models continues to grow, the importance of effective prompt engineering has come to the fore. Prompt optimization emerges as a crucial challenge, as it has a direct impact on model performance and the extraction of relevant information. Recently, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promise in addressing this issue, paving the way for novel optimization strategies. In this work, we propose a evolutionary multi-objective (EMO) approach specifically tailored for prompt optimization called EMO-Prompts, using sentiment analysis as a case study. We use sentiment analysis capabilities as our experimental targets. Our results demonstrate that EMO-Prompts effectively generates prompts capable of guiding the LLM to produce texts embodying two conflicting emotions simultaneously.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EvoApps at EvoStar 2024</p></details> |
| **[Dialogue for Prompting: a Policy-Gradient-Based Discrete Prompt Generation for Few-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07272v2)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) paradigm have succeeded substantially in few-shot natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover, subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality, robustness, and generalization ability.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 Main Track |
| **[Black-Box Tuning of Vision-Language Models with Effective Gradient Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15901v1)** | 2023-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have provided an effective way for adapting large vision-language models to specific tasks or scenarios. Typically, they learn a very small scale of parameters for pre-trained models in a white-box formulation, which assumes model architectures to be known and parameters to be accessible. However, large models are often not open-source due to considerations of preventing abuse or commercial factors, hence posing a barrier to the deployment of white-box PEFT methods. To alleviate the dependence on model accessibility, we introduce collaborative black-box tuning (CBBT) for both textual prompt optimization and output feature adaptation for black-box models. Specifically, considering that the backpropagation gradients are blocked, we approximate the gradients of textual prompts by analyzing the predictions with perturbed prompts. Secondly, a lightweight adapter is deployed over the output feature of the inaccessible model, further facilitating the model adaptation process. Empowered with these designs, our CBBT is extensively evaluated on eleven downstream benchmarks and achieves remarkable improvements compared to existing black-box VL adaptation methods. Code is released at https://github.com/guozix/cbbt.</p></details> |  |

However, most Med-VLP models learn task-specific representations independently from scratch, thereby leading to great inflexibility when they work across multiple fine-tuning tasks. In this work, we propose UniDCP, a Unified medical vision-language model with Dynamic Cross-modal learnable Prompts, which can be plastically applied to multiple medical vision-language tasks. Specifically, we explicitly construct a unified framework to harmonize diverse inputs from multiple pretraining tasks by leveraging cross-modal prompts for unification, which accordingly can accommodate heterogeneous medical fine-tuning tasks. Furthermore, we conceive a dynamic cross-modal prompt optimizing strategy that optimizes the prompts within the shareable space for implicitly processing the shareable clinic knowledge. UniDCP is the first Med-VLP model capable of performing all 8 medical uni-modal and cross-modal tasks over 14 corresponding datasets, consistently yielding superior results over diverse state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent of their applicability in news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first framework for news recommendation that leverages the capabilities of LLMs through prompt engineering. This system incorporates a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process, enhancing the LLM-based recommender's ability to align news content with user preferences and interests more effectively. Moreover, this study offers insights into the effective use of LLMs in news recommendation, emphasizing both the advantages and the challenges of incorporating LLMs into recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, and 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[PromptAgent: Strategic Planning with Language Models Enables Expert-level Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427v2)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Highly effective, task-specific prompts are often heavily engineered by experts to integrate detailed instructions and domain insights based on a deep understanding of both instincts of large language models (LLMs) and the intricacies of the target task. However, automating the generation of such expert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-error exploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depth instructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive error feedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examine intermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions), simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showing it significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent prompt optimization baselines. Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, detailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Large Language Models for Intent-Driven Session Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07552v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-aware session recommendation (ISR) is pivotal in discerning user intents within sessions for precise predictions. Traditional approaches, however, face limitations due to their presumption of a uniform number of intents across all sessions. This assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of user sessions, where the number and type of intentions can significantly vary. In addition, these methods typically operate in latent spaces, thus hinder the model's transparency.Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel ISR approach, utilizing the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). First, this approach begins by generating an initial prompt that guides LLMs to predict the next item in a session, based on the varied intents manifested in user sessions. Then, to refine this process, we introduce an innovative prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively self-reflects and adjusts prompts. Furthermore, our prompt selection module, built upon the LLMs' broad adaptability, swiftly selects the most optimized prompts across diverse domains. This new paradigm empowers LLMs to discern diverse user intents at a semantic level, leading to more accurate and interpretable session recommendations. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, marking a significant advancement in ISR systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous diffusion-CLIP-based pipelines that involve tedious per-prompt optimizations, Prompt2NeRF-PIL is capable of generating a variety of 3D objects with a single forward pass, leveraging a pre-trained implicit latent space of NeRF parameters. Furthermore, in zero-shot tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the NeRFs produced by our method serve as semantically informative initializations, significantly accelerating the inference process of existing prompt-to-NeRF methods. Specifically, we will show that our approach speeds up the text-to-NeRF model DreamFusion and the 3D reconstruction speed of the image-to-NeRF method Zero-1-to-3 by 3 to 5 times.</p></details> |  |

This fact has sparked the interest of the community in quantifying the amount of factual knowledge present in PLMs, as this explains their performance on downstream tasks, and potentially justifies their use as knowledge bases. In this work, we survey methods and datasets that are used to probe PLMs for factual knowledge. Our contributions are: (1) We propose a categorization scheme for factual probing methods that is based on how their inputs, outputs and the probed PLMs are adapted; (2) We provide an overview of the datasets used for factual probing; (3) We synthesize insights about knowledge retention and prompt optimization in PLMs, analyze obstacles to adopting PLMs as knowledge bases and outline directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2023</p></details> |

Thus, they can be seen as stochastic language layers in a language network, where the learnable parameters are the natural language prompts at each layer. By stacking two such layers and feeding the output of one layer to the next, we obtain a Deep Language Network (DLN). We first show how to effectively perform prompt optimization for a 1-Layer language network (DLN-1). Then, we present an extension that applies to 2-layer DLNs (DLN-2), where two prompts must be learned. The key idea is to consider the output of the first layer as a latent variable, which requires inference, and prompts to be learned as the parameters of the generative distribution. We first test the effectiveness of DLN-1 in multiple reasoning and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we show that DLN-2 can reach higher performance than a single layer, showing promise that we might reach comparable performance to GPT-4, even when each LLM in the network is smaller and less powerful.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[A Bayesian approach for prompt optimization in pre-trained language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00471v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prompt is a sequence of symbol or tokens, selected from a vocabulary according to some rule, which is prepended/concatenated to a textual query. A key problem is how to select the sequence of tokens: in this paper we formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem. The high dimensionality of the token space com-pounded by the length of the prompt sequence requires a very efficient solution. In this paper we propose a Bayesian optimization method, executed in a continuous em-bedding of the combinatorial space. In this paper we focus on hard prompt tuning (HPT) which directly searches for discrete tokens to be added to the text input with-out requiring access to the large language model (LLM) and can be used also when LLM is available only as a black-box. This is critically important if LLMs are made available in the Model as a Service (MaaS) manner as in GPT-4. The current manu-script is focused on the optimization of discrete prompts for classification tasks. The discrete prompts give rise to difficult combinatorial optimization problem which easily become intractable given the dimension of the token space in realistic applications. The optimization method considered in this paper is Bayesian optimization (BO) which has become the dominant approach in black-box optimization for its sample efficiency along with its modular structure and versatility. In this paper we use BoTorch, a library for Bayesian optimization research built on top of pyTorch. Albeit preliminary and obtained using a 'vanilla' version of BO, the experiments on RoB-ERTa on six benchmarks, show a good performance across a variety of tasks and enable an analysis of the tradeoff between size of the search space, accuracy and wall clock time.</p></details> |  |

With the ever-increasing power of GAI, especially the emergence of Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) that contain billions of parameters and prompt engineering methods (i.e., finding the best prompts for the given task), the application range of AIGC is rapidly expanding, covering various forms of information for human, systems, and networks, such as network designs, channel coding, and optimization solutions. In this article, we present the concept of mobile-edge AI-Generated Everything (AIGX). Specifically, we first review the building blocks of AIGX, the evolution from AIGC to AIGX, as well as practical AIGX applications. Then, we present a unified mobile-edge AIGX framework, which employs edge devices to provide PFM-empowered AIGX services and optimizes such services via prompt engineering. More importantly, we demonstrate that suboptimal prompts lead to poor generation quality, which adversely affects user satisfaction, edge network performance, and resource utilization. Accordingly, we conduct a case study, showcasing how to train an effective prompt optimizer using ChatGPT and investigating how much improvement is possible with prompt engineering in terms of user experience, quality of generation, and network performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figure |
| **[Read-only Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Few-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14960v2)** | 2023-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has proven effective in adapting pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks. These methods aim to adapt the pre-trained models by introducing learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained weights frozen. However, learnable prompts can affect the internal representation within the self-attention module, which may negatively impact performance variance and generalization, especially in data-deficient settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Read-only Prompt Optimization (RPO). RPO leverages masked attention to prevent the internal representation shift in the pre-trained model. Further, to facilitate the optimization of RPO, the read-only prompts are initialized based on special tokens of the pre-trained model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RPO outperforms CLIP and CoCoOp in base-to-new generalization and domain generalization while displaying better robustness. Also, the proposed method achieves better generalization on extremely data-deficient settings, while improving parameter efficiency and computational overhead.

| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v2)** | 2023-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them, that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods mostly focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs are usually expensive in terms of GPU compute; worse still, LLMs of interest are oftentimes not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO is model-agnostic and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version, and 10% for GPT-4. Importantly, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/BPO.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, many evaluation studies have found that their performance on medical imaging modalities to be underwhelming compared to conventional deep learning methods. In the world of large pre-trained language and vision-language models, learning prompt from downstream tasks has achieved considerable success in improving performance. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Prompt Optimization Technique for foundation models like SAM (SAMPOT) that utilizes the downstream segmentation task to optimize the human-provided prompt to obtain improved performance. We demonstrate the utility of SAMPOT on lung segmentation in chest X-ray images and obtain an improvement on a significant number of cases ($\sim75\%$) over human-provided initial prompts. We hope this work will lead to further investigations in the nascent field of automatic visual prompt-tuning.</p></details> |  |

This approach offers important advantages, such as generating interpretable prompts and being compatible with black-box foundation models. However, the substantial prompt space size poses challenges for RL-based methods, often leading to suboptimal policy convergence. This paper introduces MultiPrompter, a new framework that views prompt optimization as a cooperative game between prompters which take turns composing a prompt together. Our cooperative prompt optimization effectively reduces the problem size and helps prompters learn optimal prompts. We test our method on the text-to-image task and show its ability to generate higher-quality images than baselines.</p></details> |  |

We use machine-generated prompts to probe how models respond to input that is not composed of natural language expressions. We study the behavior of models of different sizes in multiple semantic tasks in response to both continuous and discrete machine-generated prompts, and compare it to the behavior in response to human-generated natural-language prompts. Even when producing a similar output, machine-generated and human prompts trigger different response patterns through the network processing pathways, including different perplexities, different attention and output entropy distributions, and different unit activation profiles. We provide preliminary insight into the nature of the units activated by different prompt types, suggesting that only natural language prompts recruit a genuinely linguistic circuit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2023 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

We provide empirical evidence that state-of-the-art LLMs suffer from poor generalizability on reasoning types beyond those seen in the prompt. To remedy this, we propose a Mixture-of-Reasoning-Experts (MoRE) framework that ensembles diverse specialized language models. We specialize the backbone language model with prompts optimized for different reasoning categories, including factual, multihop, mathematical, and commonsense reasoning. Our key insight is to leverage agreement among the specialized experts to select the best answer for each question, or to abstain from answering. This gives MoRE higher accuracy than any single specialized model on a collection of 12 QA datasets from four reasoning types. Beyond generalizability, the interpretable design of MoRE improves selective question answering results compared to baselines without incorporating inter-expert agreement. This framework is also more interpretable and useful to human consumers of QA outputs. Our human study confirms that presenting expert predictions and the answer selection process helps annotators more accurately calibrate when to trust the system's output. We release all code and data to facilitate future work.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Findings |

We propose a simple and nonparametric solution to this problem, Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which is inspired by numerical gradient descent to automatically improve prompts, assuming access to training data and an LLM API. The algorithm uses minibatches of data to form natural language "gradients" that criticize the current prompt. The gradients are then "propagated" into the prompt by editing the prompt in the opposite semantic direction of the gradient. These gradient descent steps are guided by a beam search and bandit selection procedure which significantly improves algorithmic efficiency. Preliminary results across three benchmark NLP tasks and the novel problem of LLM jailbreak detection suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 |

Much literature collects large amounts of annotated image-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from scratch, which is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that leverage pre-trained vision-language models are put forward to avoid data collection, but they are also limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate and identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP visual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP textual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design endows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2) generalization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with different generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion model, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing.

In this paper, we propose MLLM-DataEngine, a novel closed-loop system that bridges data generation, model training, and evaluation. Within each loop iteration, the MLLM-DataEngine first analyze the weakness of the model based on the evaluation results, then generate a proper incremental dataset for the next training iteration and enhance the model capability iteratively. Compared with previous data collection methods which are separate from the benchmarking, the data generated by MLLM-DataEngine shows better targeting, quality, and correctness. For targeting, we propose an Adaptive Bad-case Sampling module, which adjusts the ratio of different types of data within each incremental dataset based on the benchmarking results. For quality, we resort to GPT-4 to generate high-quality data with each given data type. For correctness, prompt design is critical for the data generation results. Rather than previous hand-crafted prompt, we propose an Interactive Prompt Optimization strategy, which optimizes the prompt with the multi-round interaction between human and GPT, and improve the correctness of generated data greatly. Through extensive experiments, we find our MLLM-DataEngine could boost the MLLM capability in a targeted and automatic manner, with only a few human participation. We hope it could be a general solution for the following MLLMs building.

First, there is no convenient interface for domain experts to provide domain knowledge easily. Second, they require significant training data collection overheads. Third, the accuracy suffers from complicated schema changes. To bridge this gap, we present a novel approach that leverages the unique capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in coding, complex reasoning, and zero-shot learning to generate SQL code that transforms the source datasets into the target datasets. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by designing an LLM-based framework, termed SQLMorpher, which comprises a prompt generator that integrates the initial prompt with optional domain knowledge and historical patterns in external databases. It also implements an iterative prompt optimization mechanism that automatically improves the prompt based on flaw detection. The key contributions of this work include (1) pioneering an end-to-end LLM-based solution for data transformation, (2) developing a benchmark dataset of 105 real-world building energy data transformation problems, and (3) conducting an extensive empirical evaluation where our approach achieved 96% accuracy in all 105 problems. SQLMorpher demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing LLMs in complex, domain-specific challenges, highlighting the potential of their potential to drive sustainable solutions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Both are unlikely to lead to good results without a substantial amount of data and computational resources. Prompt learning without changing the parameters of a large language model presents a promising alternative. It is a cost-effective approach, while still achieving competitive results. While this procedure is now established for zero- and few-shot text classification and structured prediction, it has received limited attention in conditional text generation. We present the first automatic prompt optimization approach for emotion-conditioned text generation with instruction-fine-tuned models. Our method uses an iterative optimization procedure that changes the prompt by adding, removing, or replacing tokens. As objective function, we only require a text classifier that measures the realization of the conditional variable in the generated text. We evaluate the method on emotion-conditioned text generation with a focus on event reports and compare it to manually designed prompts that also act as the seed for the optimization procedure. The optimized prompts achieve 0.75 macro-average F1 to fulfill the emotion condition in contrast to manually designed seed prompts with only 0.22 macro-average F1.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoHint: Automatic Prompt Optimization with Hint Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07415v2)** | 2023-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents AutoHint, a novel framework for automatic prompt engineering and optimization for Large Language Models (LLM). While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable ability in achieving high-quality annotation in various tasks, the key to applying this ability to specific tasks lies in developing high-quality prompts. Thus we propose a framework to inherit the merits of both in-context learning and zero-shot learning by incorporating enriched instructions derived from input-output demonstrations to optimize original prompt. We refer to the enrichment as the hint and propose a framework to automatically generate the hint from labeled data. More concretely, starting from an initial prompt, our method first instructs a LLM to deduce new hints for selected samples from incorrect predictions, and then summarizes from per-sample hints and adds the results back to the initial prompt to form a new, enriched instruction. The proposed method is evaluated on the BIG-Bench Instruction Induction dataset for both zero-shot and few-short prompts, where experiments demonstrate our method is able to significantly boost accuracy for multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023: Foundations and Applications in Large-scale AI Models-Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompt-based Learning workshop</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling the Potential of Knowledge-Prompted ChatGPT for Enhancing Drug Trafficking Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03699v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter have emerged as critical channels for drug marketing and illegal sale. Detecting and labeling online illicit drug trafficking activities becomes important in addressing this issue. However, the effectiveness of conventional supervised learning methods in detecting drug trafficking heavily relies on having access to substantial amounts of labeled data, while data annotation is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these models often face challenges in accurately identifying trafficking activities when drug dealers use deceptive language and euphemisms to avoid detection. To overcome this limitation, we conduct the first systematic study on leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to detect illicit drug trafficking activities on social media. We propose an analytical framework to compose \emph{knowledge-informed prompts}, which serve as the interface that humans can interact with and use LLMs to perform the detection task. Additionally, we design a Monte Carlo dropout based prompt optimization method to further to improve performance and interpretability. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline language models in terms of drug trafficking detection accuracy, showing a remarkable improvement of nearly 12\%. By integrating prior knowledge and the proposed prompts, ChatGPT can effectively identify and label drug trafficking activities on social networks, even in the presence of deceptive language and euphemisms used by drug dealers to evade detection. The implications of our research extend to social networks, emphasizing the importance of incorporating prior knowledge and scenario-based prompts into analytical tools to improve online security and public safety.</p></details> |  |

Often these models can be prompted with multi-modal inputs that range from natural language descriptions over images to point clouds. In this paper, we propose topological data analysis (TDA) guided prompt optimization for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and show preliminary results in the biological image segmentation domain. Our approach replaces the standard grid search approach that is used in the original implementation and finds point locations based on their topological significance. Our results show that the TDA optimized point cloud is much better suited for finding small objects and massively reduces computational complexity despite the extra step in scenarios which require many segmentations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally-Extended Prompts Optimization for SAM in Interactive Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08958v1)** | 2023-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) has recently emerged as a foundation model for addressing image segmentation. Owing to the intrinsic complexity of medical images and the high annotation cost, the medical image segmentation (MIS) community has been encouraged to investigate SAM's zero-shot capabilities to facilitate automatic annotation. Inspired by the extraordinary accomplishments of interactive medical image segmentation (IMIS) paradigm, this paper focuses on assessing the potential of SAM's zero-shot capabilities within the IMIS paradigm to amplify its benefits in the MIS domain. Regrettably, we observe that SAM's vulnerability to prompt forms (e.g., points, bounding boxes) becomes notably pronounced in IMIS. This leads us to develop a framework that adaptively offers suitable prompt forms for human experts. We refer to the framework above as temporally-extended prompts optimization (TEPO) and model it as a Markov decision process, solvable through reinforcement learning. Numerical experiments on the standardized benchmark BraTS2020 demonstrate that the learned TEPO agent can further enhance SAM's zero-shot capability in the MIS context.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

DreamFusion recently achieved high-quality results but requires a lengthy, per-prompt optimization to create 3D objects. To address this, we amortize optimization over text prompts by training on many prompts simultaneously with a unified model, instead of separately. With this, we share computation across a prompt set, training in less time than per-prompt optimization. Our framework - Amortized text-to-3D (ATT3D) - enables knowledge-sharing between prompts to generalize to unseen setups and smooth interpolations between text for novel assets and simple animations.</p></details> | 22 pages, 20 figures |
| **[ZegOT: Zero-shot Segmentation Through Optimal Transport of Text Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12171v2)** | 2023-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has led to great promise in zero-shot semantic segmentation by transferring image-text aligned knowledge to pixel-level classification. However, existing methods usually require an additional image encoder or retraining/tuning the CLIP module. Here, we propose a novel Zero-shot segmentation with Optimal Transport (ZegOT) method that matches multiple text prompts with frozen image embeddings through optimal transport. In particular, we introduce a novel Multiple Prompt Optimal Transport Solver (MPOT), which is designed to learn an optimal mapping between multiple text prompts and visual feature maps of the frozen image encoder hidden layers. This unique mapping method facilitates each of the multiple text prompts to effectively focus on distinct visual semantic attributes. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over existing Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZS3) approaches.</p></details> | 18pages, 8 figures |
| **[Discrete Prompt Optimization via Constrained Generation for Zero-shot Re-ranker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13729v1)** | 2023-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Re-rankers, which order retrieved documents with respect to the relevance score on the given query, have gained attention for the information retrieval (IR) task. Rather than fine-tuning the pre-trained language model (PLM), the large-scale language model (LLM) is utilized as a zero-shot re-ranker with excellent results. While LLM is highly dependent on the prompts, the impact and the optimization of the prompts for the zero-shot re-ranker are not explored yet. Along with highlighting the impact of optimization on the zero-shot re-ranker, we propose a novel discrete prompt optimization method, Constrained Prompt generation (Co-Prompt), with the metric estimating the optimum for re-ranking. Co-Prompt guides the generated texts from PLM toward optimal prompts based on the metric without parameter update. The experimental results demonstrate that Co-Prompt leads to outstanding re-ranking performance against the baselines. Also, Co-Prompt generates more interpretable prompts for humans against other prompt optimization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of ACL 2023 Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[DRPT: Disentangled and Recurrent Prompt Tuning for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01239v1)** | 2023-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel concepts composed of known knowledge without training samples. Standard CZSL either identifies visual primitives or enhances unseen composed entities, and as a result, entanglement between state and object primitives cannot be fully utilized. Admittedly, vision-language models (VLMs) could naturally cope with CZSL through tuning prompts, while uneven entanglement leads prompts to be dragged into local optimum. In this paper, we take a further step to introduce a novel Disentangled and Recurrent Prompt Tuning framework termed DRPT to better tap the potential of VLMs in CZSL. Specifically, the state and object primitives are deemed as learnable tokens of vocabulary embedded in prompts and tuned on seen compositions. Instead of jointly tuning state and object, we devise a disentangled and recurrent tuning strategy to suppress the traction force caused by entanglement and gradually optimize the token parameters, leading to a better prompt space. Notably, we develop a progressive fine-tuning procedure that allows for incremental updates to the prompts, optimizing the object first, then the state, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the optimization of state and object is independent, thus clearer features can be learned to further alleviate the issue of entangling misleading optimization. Moreover, we quantify and analyze the entanglement in CZSL and supplement entanglement rebalancing optimization schemes. DRPT surpasses representative state-of-the-art methods on extensive benchmark datasets, demonstrating superiority in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity-Aware Meta Visual Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08138v1)** | 2023-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Diversity-Aware Meta Visual Prompting~(DAM-VP), an efficient and effective prompting method for transferring pre-trained models to downstream tasks with frozen backbone. A challenging issue in visual prompting is that image datasets sometimes have a large data diversity whereas a per-dataset generic prompt can hardly handle the complex distribution shift toward the original pretraining data distribution properly. To address this issue, we propose a dataset Diversity-Aware prompting strategy whose initialization is realized by a Meta-prompt. Specifically, we cluster the downstream dataset into small homogeneity subsets in a diversity-adaptive way, with each subset has its own prompt optimized separately. Such a divide-and-conquer design reduces the optimization difficulty greatly and significantly boosts the prompting performance. Furthermore, all the prompts are initialized with a meta-prompt, which is learned across several datasets. It is a bootstrapped paradigm, with the key observation that the prompting knowledge learned from previous datasets could help the prompt to converge faster and perform better on a new dataset. During inference, we dynamically select a proper prompt for each input, based on the feature distance between the input and each subset. Through extensive experiments, our DAM-VP demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness, clearly surpassing previous prompting methods in a series of downstream datasets for different pretraining models.

| **[DeltaEdit: Exploring Text-free Training for Text-Driven Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06285v1)** | 2023-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven image manipulation remains challenging in training or inference flexibility. Conditional generative models depend heavily on expensive annotated training data. Meanwhile, recent frameworks, which leverage pre-trained vision-language models, are limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. In this work, we propose a novel framework named \textit{DeltaEdit} to address these problems. Our key idea is to investigate and identify a space, namely delta image and text space that has well-aligned distribution between CLIP visual feature differences of two images and CLIP textual embedding differences of source and target texts. Based on the CLIP delta space, the DeltaEdit network is designed to map the CLIP visual features differences to the editing directions of StyleGAN at training phase. Then, in inference phase, DeltaEdit predicts the StyleGAN's editing directions from the differences of the CLIP textual features. In this way, DeltaEdit is trained in a text-free manner. Once trained, it can well generalize to various text prompts for zero-shot inference without bells and whistles.

| **[In-context Examples Selection for Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02437v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative models show an impressive ability to perform a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using in-context learning, where a few examples are used to describe a task to the model. For Machine Translation (MT), these examples are typically randomly sampled from the development dataset with a similar distribution as the evaluation set. However, it is unclear how the choice of these in-context examples and their ordering impacts the output translation quality. In this work, we aim to understand the properties of good in-context examples for MT in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. We show that the translation quality and the domain of the in-context examples matter and that 1-shot noisy unrelated example can have a catastrophic impact on output quality. While concatenating multiple random examples reduces the effect of noise, a single good prompt optimized to maximize translation quality on the development dataset can elicit learned information from the pre-trained language model. Adding similar examples based on an n-gram overlap with the test source significantly and consistently improves the translation quality of the outputs, outperforming a strong kNN-MT baseline in 2 out of 4 out-of-domain datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages; 4 figures; 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[RLPrompt: Optimizing Discrete Text Prompts with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12548v3)** | 2022-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has shown impressive success in enabling large pretrained language models (LMs) to perform diverse NLP tasks, especially when only few downstream data are available. Automatically finding the optimal prompt for each task, however, is challenging. Most existing work resorts to tuning soft prompt (e.g., embeddings) which falls short of interpretability, reusability across LMs, and applicability when gradients are not accessible. Discrete prompt, on the other hand, is difficult to optimize, and is often created by "enumeration (e.g., paraphrasing)-then-selection" heuristics that do not explore the prompt space systematically. This paper proposes RLPrompt, an efficient discrete prompt optimization approach with reinforcement learning (RL). RLPrompt formulates a parameter-efficient policy network that generates the desired discrete prompt after training with reward. To overcome the complexity and stochasticity of reward signals by the large LM environment, we incorporate effective reward stabilization that substantially enhances the training efficiency. RLPrompt is flexibly applicable to different types of LMs, such as masked (e.g., BERT) and left-to-right models (e.g., GPTs), for both classification and generation tasks. Experiments on few-shot classification and unsupervised text style transfer show superior performance over a wide range of existing finetuning or prompting methods. Interestingly, the resulting optimized prompts are often ungrammatical gibberish text; and surprisingly, those gibberish prompts are transferrable between different LMs to retain significant performance, indicating LM prompting may not follow human language patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2022 Camera Ready.

Here we address some remaining issues less reported by the GPT-3 paper, such as a non-English LM, the performances of different sized models, and the effect of recently introduced prompt optimization on in-context learning. To achieve this, we introduce HyperCLOVA, a Korean variant of 82B GPT-3 trained on a Korean-centric corpus of 560B tokens. Enhanced by our Korean-specific tokenization, HyperCLOVA with our training configuration shows state-of-the-art in-context zero-shot and few-shot learning performances on various downstream tasks in Korean. Also, we show the performance benefits of prompt-based learning and demonstrate how it can be integrated into the prompt engineering pipeline. Then we discuss the possibility of materializing the No Code AI paradigm by providing AI prototyping capabilities to non-experts of ML by introducing HyperCLOVA studio, an interactive prompt engineering interface. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential of our methods with three successful in-house applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2021 as a long paper.
