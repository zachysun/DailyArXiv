| **[Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18916v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiTEC-WDN: A Large-Scale Dataset of Hydraulic Scenarios across Multiple Water Distribution Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17167v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17167v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy restrictions hinder the sharing of real-world Water Distribution Network (WDN) models, limiting the application of emerging data-driven machine learning, which typically requires extensive observations. To address this challenge, we propose the dataset DiTEC-WDN that comprises 36,000 unique scenarios simulated over either short-term (24 hours) or long-term (1 year) periods. We constructed this dataset using an automated pipeline that optimizes crucial parameters (e.g., pressure, flow rate, and demand patterns), facilitates large-scale simulations, and records discrete, synthetic but hydraulically realistic states under standard conditions via rule validation and post-hoc analysis. With a total of 228 million generated graph-based states, DiTEC-WDN can support a variety of machine-learning tasks, including graph-level, node-level, and link-level regression, as well as time-series forecasting. This contribution, released under a public license, encourages open scientific research in the critical water sector, eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive data, and fulfills the need for a large-scale water distribution network benchmark for study comparisons and scenario analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Scientific Data.

| **[Adaptive Machine Learning for Resource-Constrained Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18634v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18634v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Things is an example domain where data is perpetually generated in ever-increasing quantities, reflecting the proliferation of connected devices and the formation of continuous data streams over time. Consequently, the demand for ad-hoc, cost-effective machine learning solutions must adapt to this evolving data influx. This study tackles the task of offloading in small gateways, exacerbated by their dynamic availability over time. An approach leveraging CPU utilization metrics using online and continual machine learning techniques is proposed to predict gateway availability. These methods are compared to popular machine learning algorithms and a recent time-series foundation model, Lag-Llama, for fine-tuned and zero-shot setups. Their performance is benchmarked on a dataset of CPU utilization measurements over time from an IoT gateway and focuses on model metrics such as prediction errors, training and inference times, and memory consumption. Our primary objective is to study new efficient ways to predict CPU performance in IoT environments. Across various scenarios, our findings highlight that ensemble and online methods offer promising results for this task in terms of accuracy while maintaining a low resource footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, accepted at DELTA 2024 (Workshop on Discovering Drift Phenomena in Evolving Landscapes), co-located with ACM SIGKDD 2024.

| **[Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558v3)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.13558v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate prediction of RUL for lithium-ion batteries is crucial for enhancing the reliability and longevity of energy storage systems. Traditional methods for RUL prediction often struggle with issues such as data sparsity, varying battery chemistries, and the inability to capture complex degradation patterns over time. In this study, we propose a survival analysis-based framework combined with deep learning models to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, we utilize five advanced models: the Cox-type models (Cox, CoxPH, and CoxTime) and two machine-learning-based models (DeepHit and MTLR). These models address the challenges of accurate RUL estimation by transforming raw time-series battery data into survival data, including key degradation indicators such as voltage, current, and internal resistance. Advanced feature extraction techniques enhance the model's robustness in diverse real-world scenarios, including varying charging conditions and battery chemistries. Our models are tested using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and minimizing overfitting. Experimental results show that our survival-based framework significantly improves RUL prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for battery management and maintenance optimization. This study contributes to the advancement of predictive maintenance in battery technology, offering valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance the operational lifespan of lithium-ion batteries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Tensor PCA via Tensor Decomposition for Unsupervised Feature Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16985v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.16985v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, introducing Tensor Decomposition (TD) techniques into unsupervised feature selection (UFS) has been an emerging research topic. A tensor structure is beneficial for mining the relations between different modes and helps relieve the computation burden. However, while existing methods exploit TD to preserve the data tensor structure, they do not consider the influence of data orientation and thus have difficulty in handling orientation-specific data such as time series. To solve the above problem, we utilize the orientation-dependent tensor-tensor product from Tensor Singular Value Decomposition based on *M-product (T-SVDM) and extend the one-dimensional Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to a tensor form. The proposed sparse tensor PCA model can constrain sparsity at the specified mode and yield sparse tensor principal components, enhancing flexibility and accuracy in learning feature relations. To ensure fast convergence and a flexible description of feature correlation, we develop a convex version specially designed for general UFS tasks and propose an efficient slice-by-slice algorithm that performs dual optimization in the transform domain. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and remarkable computational efficiency of the proposed method for tensor data of diverse structures over the state-of-the-arts. With a proper combination of data orientation and transform domain, our method is promising for various applications. The codes related to our proposed methods and the experiments are available at https://github.com/zjj20212035/STPCA.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoCA: Robust Contrastive One-class Time Series Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18385v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18385v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accumulation of time-series signals and the absence of labels make time-series Anomaly Detection (AD) a self-supervised task of deep learning. Methods based on normality assumptions face the following three limitations: (1) A single assumption could hardly characterize the whole normality or lead to some deviation. (2) Some assumptions may go against the principle of AD. (3) Their basic assumption is that the training data is uncontaminated (free of anomalies), which is unrealistic in practice, leading to a decline in robustness. This paper proposes a novel robust approach, RoCA, which is the first to address all of the above three challenges, as far as we are aware. It fuses the separated assumptions of one-class classification and contrastive learning in a single training process to characterize a more complete so-called normality. Additionally, it monitors the training data and computes a carefully designed anomaly score throughout the training process. This score helps identify latent anomalies, which are then used to define the classification boundary, inspired by the concept of outlier exposure. The performance on AIOps datasets improved by 6% compared to when contamination was not considered (COCA). On two large and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, the performance increased by 5% to 10%. RoCA achieves the highest average performance on both univariate and multivariate datasets.

| **[PS-EIP: Robust Photometric Stereo Based on Event Interval Profile](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18341v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18341v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the energy-efficient photometric stereo method using an event camera has been proposed to recover surface normals from events triggered by changes in logarithmic Lambertian reflections under a moving directional light source. However, EventPS treats each event interval independently, making it sensitive to noise, shadows, and non-Lambertian reflections. This paper proposes Photometric Stereo based on Event Interval Profile (PS-EIP), a robust method that recovers pixelwise surface normals from a time-series profile of event intervals. By exploiting the continuity of the profile and introducing an outlier detection method based on profile shape, our approach enhances robustness against outliers from shadows and specular reflections. Experiments using real event data from 3D-printed objects demonstrate that PS-EIP significantly improves robustness to outliers compared to EventPS's deep-learning variant, EventPS-FCN, without relying on deep learning.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |
| **[Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18309v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems, offering interpretable uncertainty quantification and inherent regularization. However, existing GPSSMs face significant challenges in handling high-dimensional, non-stationary systems due to computational inefficiencies, limited scalability, and restrictive stationarity assumptions. In this paper, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) to address these limitations. Our approach leverages a single shared Gaussian process (GP) combined with normalizing flows and Bayesian neural networks, enabling efficient modeling of complex, high-dimensional state transitions while preserving scalability. To address the lack of closed-form expressions for the implicit process in the transformed GP, we follow its generative process and introduce an efficient variational inference algorithm, aided by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), to enable computationally tractable learning and inference. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14474v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2307.14474v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Tensor-based homogeneous polynomial dynamical system analysis from data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17774v1)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17774v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous complex real-world systems, such as those in biological, ecological, and social networks, exhibit higher-order interactions that are often modeled using polynomial dynamical systems or homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs). However, identifying system parameters and analyzing key system-theoretic properties remain challenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity, particularly for large-scale systems. To address these challenges, we develop an innovative computational framework in this article that leverages advanced tensor decomposition techniques, namely tensor train and hierarchical Tucker decompositions, to facilitate efficient identification and analysis of HPDSs that can be equivalently represented by tensors. Specifically, we introduce memory-efficient system identification techniques for directly estimating system parameters represented through tensor decompositions from time-series data. Additionally, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for determining controllability and observability using the tensor decomposition-based representations of HPDSs, accompanied by detailed complexity analyses that demonstrate significant reductions in computational demands. The effectiveness and efficiency of our framework are validated through numerical examples.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Renewable Energy Transition in South America: Predictive Analysis of Generation Capacity by 2050](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17771v1)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17771v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this research, renewable energy expansion in South America up to 2050 is predicted based on machine learning models that are trained on past energy data. The research employs gradient boosting regression and Prophet time series forecasting to make predictions of future generation capacities for solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and other renewable sources in South American nations. Model output analysis indicates staggering future expansion in the generation of renewable energy, with solar and wind energy registering the highest expansion rates. Geospatial visualization methods were applied to illustrate regional disparities in the utilization of renewable energy. The results forecast South America to record nearly 3-fold growth in the generation of renewable energy by the year 2050, with Brazil and Chile spearheading regional development. Such projections help design energy policy, investment strategy, and climate change mitigation throughout the region, in helping the developing economies to transition to sustainable energy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Enhancing Startup Success Predictions in Venture Capital: A GraphRAG Augmented Multivariate Time Series Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09420v5)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.09420v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Venture Capital (VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Financial AI</p></details> |
| **[Sentinel: Multi-Patch Transformer with Temporal and Channel Attention for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17658v1)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17658v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based time series forecasting has recently gained strong interest due to the ability of transformers to model sequential data. Most of the state-of-the-art architectures exploit either temporal or inter-channel dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in multivariate time-series forecasting where both types of dependencies are crucial. We propose Sentinel, a full transformer-based architecture composed of an encoder able to extract contextual information from the channel dimension, and a decoder designed to capture causal relations and dependencies across the temporal dimension. Additionally, we introduce a multi-patch attention mechanism, which leverages the patching process to structure the input sequence in a way that can be naturally integrated into the transformer architecture, replacing the multi-head splitting process. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that Sentinel, because of its ability to "monitor" both the temporal and the inter-channel dimension, achieves better or comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Dynamic Trend Filtering through Trend Point Detection with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03665v2)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.03665v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trend filtering simplifies complex time series data by applying smoothness to filter out noise while emphasizing proximity to the original data. However, existing trend filtering methods fail to reflect abrupt changes in the trend due to `approximateness,' resulting in constant smoothness. This approximateness uniformly filters out the tail distribution of time series data, characterized by extreme values, including both abrupt changes and noise. In this paper, we propose Trend Point Detection formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), a novel approach to identifying essential points that should be reflected in the trend, departing from approximations. We term these essential points as Dynamic Trend Points (DTPs) and extract trends by interpolating them. To identify DTPs, we utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) within a discrete action space and a forecasting sum-of-squares loss function as a reward, referred to as the Dynamic Trend Filtering network (DTF-net). DTF-net integrates flexible noise filtering, preserving critical original subsequences while removing noise as required for other subsequences. We demonstrate that DTF-net excels at capturing abrupt changes compared to other trend filtering algorithms and enhances forecasting performance, as abrupt changes are predicted rather than smoothed out.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17546v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 13 figures, submitted to 'Journal of Physics: Complexity'</p></details> |
| **[CausalRivers -- Scaling up benchmarking of causal discovery for real-world time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17452v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17452v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery, or identifying causal relationships from observational data, is a notoriously challenging task, with numerous methods proposed to tackle it. Despite this, in-the-wild evaluation of these methods is still lacking, as works frequently rely on synthetic data evaluation and sparse real-world examples under critical theoretical assumptions. Real-world causal structures, however, are often complex, making it hard to decide on a proper causal discovery strategy. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalRivers, the largest in-the-wild causal discovery benchmarking kit for time-series data to date. CausalRivers features an extensive dataset on river discharge that covers the eastern German territory (666 measurement stations) and the state of Bavaria (494 measurement stations). It spans the years 2019 to 2023 with a 15-minute temporal resolution. Further, we provide additional data from a flood around the Elbe River, as an event with a pronounced distributional shift. Leveraging multiple sources of information and time-series meta-data, we constructed two distinct causal ground truth graphs (Bavaria and eastern Germany). These graphs can be sampled to generate thousands of subgraphs to benchmark causal discovery across diverse and challenging settings. To demonstrate the utility of CausalRivers, we evaluate several causal discovery approaches through a set of experiments to identify areas for improvement. CausalRivers has the potential to facilitate robust evaluations and comparisons of causal discovery methods. Besides this primary purpose, we also expect that this dataset will be relevant for connected areas of research, such as time-series forecasting and anomaly detection. Based on this, we hope to push benchmark-driven method development that fosters advanced techniques for causal discovery, as is the case for many other areas of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, ICLR2025 main track</p></details> |
| **[NdLinear Is All You Need for Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17353v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many high-impact machine learning tasks involve multi-dimensional data (e.g., images, volumetric medical scans, multivariate time-series). Yet, most neural architectures flatten inputs, discarding critical cross-dimension information. We introduce NdLinear, a novel linear transformation that preserves these structures without extra overhead. By operating separately along each dimension, NdLinear captures dependencies that standard fully connected layers overlook. Extensive experiments across convolutional, recurrent, and transformer-based networks show significant improvements in representational power and parameter efficiency. Crucially, NdLinear serves as a foundational building block for large-scale foundation models by operating on any unimodal or multimodal data in its native form. This removes the need for flattening or modality-specific preprocessing. Ndlinear rethinks core architectural priorities beyond attention, enabling more expressive, context-aware models at scale. We propose NdLinear as a drop-in replacement for standard linear layers -- marking an important step toward next-generation neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ensemble-core/NdLinear</p></details> |
| **[Time-Series U-Net with Recurrence for Noise-Robust Imaging Photoplethysmography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17351v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17351v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote estimation of vital signs enables health monitoring for situations in which contact-based devices are either not available, too intrusive, or too expensive. In this paper, we present a modular, interpretable pipeline for pulse signal estimation from video of the face that achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly available datasets.Our imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) system consists of three modules: face and landmark detection, time-series extraction, and pulse signal/pulse rate estimation. Unlike many deep learning methods that make use of a single black-box model that maps directly from input video to output signal or heart rate, our modular approach enables each of the three parts of the pipeline to be interpreted individually. The pulse signal estimation module, which we call TURNIP (Time-Series U-Net with Recurrence for Noise-Robust Imaging Photoplethysmography), allows the system to faithfully reconstruct the underlying pulse signal waveform and uses it to measure heart rate and pulse rate variability metrics, even in the presence of motion. When parts of the face are occluded due to extreme head poses, our system explicitly detects such "self-occluded" regions and maintains estimation robustness despite the missing information. Our algorithm provides reliable heart rate estimates without the need for specialized sensors or contact with the skin, outperforming previous iPPG methods on both color (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) datasets.</p></details> | 14 Pages, 8 figures |

However, heterogeneous data across diverse regions, driven by factors such as varying consumer behavior, poses challenges to the effectiveness of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Privacy-Adaptive Clustered Federated Learning (PA-CFL) tailored for demand forecasting on heterogeneous retail data. By leveraging differential privacy and feature importance distribution, PA-CFL groups retailers into distinct ``bubbles'', each forming its own federated learning system to effectively isolate data heterogeneity. Within each bubble, Transformer models are designed to predict local sales for each client. Our experiments demonstrate that PA-CFL significantly surpasses FedAvg and outperforms local learning in demand forecasting performance across all participating clients. Compared to local learning, PA-CFL achieves a 5.4% improvement in R^2, a 69% reduction in RMSE, and a 45% decrease in MAE. Our approach enables effective FL through adaptive adjustments to diverse noise levels and the range of clients participating in each bubble. By grouping participants and proactively filtering out high-risk clients, PA-CFL mitigates potential threats to the FL system. The findings demonstrate PA-CFL's ability to enhance federated learning in time series prediction tasks with heterogeneous data, achieving a balance between forecasting accuracy and privacy preservation in retail applications. Additionally, PA-CFL's capability to detect and neutralize poisoned data from clients enhances the system's robustness and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATHENA: An In-vehicle CAN Intrusion Detection Framework Based on Physical Characteristics of Vehicle Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17067v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17067v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing interconnection between In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) and external environments, intelligent vehicles are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated external network attacks. This paper proposes ATHENA, the first IVN intrusion detection framework that adopts a vehicle-cloud integrated architecture to achieve better security performance for the resource-constrained vehicular environment. Specifically, in the cloud with sufficient resources, ATHENA uses the clustering method of multi-distribution mixture model combined with deep data mining technology to generate the raw Payload Rule Bank of IVN CAN messages, and then improves the rule quality with the help of exploitation on the first-principled physical knowledge of the vehicle system, after which the payload rules are periodically sent to the vehicle terminal. At the vehicle terminal, a simple LSTM component is used to generate the Time Rule Bank representing the long-term time series dependencies and the periodic characteristics of CAN messages, but not for any detection tasks as in traditional usage scenarios, where only the generated time rules are the candidates for further IVN intrusion detection tasks. Based on both the payload and time rules generated from cloud and vehicle terminal, ATHENA can achieve efficient intrusion detection capability by simple rule-base matching operations, rather than using complex black-box reasoning of resource-intensive neural network models, which is in fact only used for rule logic generation phase instead of the actual intrusion detection phase in our framework. Comparative experimental results on the ROAD dataset, which is current the most outstanding real-world in-vehicle CAN dataset covering new instances of sophisticated and stealthy masquerade attacks, demonstrate ATHENA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art IVN intrusion detection methods in detecting complex attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the real world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of the various causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent work highlighted certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques for a standard class of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical, including var- and R2-sortability, where the variables' variance and coefficients of determination (R2) after regressing on all other variables, respectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal methods exploit such artifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance on real-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these artifacts; notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM) avoids varsortability and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal graphs, but exhibits a reversed R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not featured in their work. We analyze which sortability patterns we expect to see in real data, and propose a method for drawing coefficients that we argue more effectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally, we propose a novel extension of our SCM generation method to the time series setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th C...</summary><p>4th Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

While pretrained time series foundation models are gaining popularity, they face the following challenges: (1) Unlike natural language tasks, time series data vary in frequency, channel numbers, historical/prediction lengths. For long-term forecasting tasks in particular, tailored fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.(2) Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA remain applicable but require adaptation to temporal characteristics. To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts. Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting and anomaly detection tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and adaptive control systems are essential to ensure seamless interaction between the wearer and the robotic device, particularly when navigating diverse and dynamic terrains. Despite the recent advances in neural networks for time series analysis, no attempts have been directed towards the classification of ground conditions, categorized into five classes and subsequently determining the ramp's slope and stair's height. In this respect, this paper presents an experimental comparison between eight deep neural network backbones to predict high-level locomotion parameters across diverse terrains. All the models are trained on the publicly available CAMARGO 2021 dataset. IMU-only data equally or outperformed IMU+EMG inputs, promoting a cost-effective and efficient design. Indeeds, using three IMU sensors, the LSTM achieved high terrain classification accuracy (0.94 +- 0.04) and precise ramp slope (1.95 +- 0.58{\deg}) and the CNN-LSTM a stair height (15.65 +- 7.40 mm) estimations. As a further contribution, SHAP analysis justified sensor reduction without performance loss, ensuring a lightweight setup. The system operates with ~2 ms inference time, supporting real-time applications.

Known for its temporal processing prowess, RC significantly lowers training costs compared to conventional recurrent neural networks. A key component in its hardware deployment is the ability to generate dynamic reservoir states. Our research introduces a novel dual-memory RC system, integrating a short-term memory via a WOx-based memristor, capable of achieving 16 distinct states encoded over 4 bits, and a long-term memory component using a TiOx-based memristor within the readout layer. We thoroughly examine both memristor types and leverage the RC system to process temporal data sets. The performance of the proposed RC system is validated through two benchmark tasks: isolated spoken digit recognition with incomplete inputs and Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The system delivered an impressive 98.84% accuracy in digit recognition and sustained a low normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.036 in the time series prediction task, underscoring its capability.

While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

We provide a rigorous mathematical framework to quantify this capacity for random linear reservoirs, showing that it is fully characterised by the spectral properties of the generalised matrix of moments of the random reservoir connectivity matrix. Our analysis focuses on reservoirs with Gaussian connectivity matrices, both symmetric and i.i.d., although the techniques extend naturally to broader classes of random matrices. In the symmetric case, the generalised matrix of moments is a Hankel matrix. Using classical estimates from random matrix theory, we establish that separation capacity deteriorates over time and that, for short inputs, optimal separation in large reservoirs is achieved when the matrix entries are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the reservoir dimension and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum input length. In the i.i.d.\ case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$, which aligns with common implementations of reservoir computing. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation as a function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and its consistency under different architectural choices.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised contrastive learning has garnered significant interest in learning effective representations from time series data with limited labels. The prevalent approach in existing contrastive learning methods consists of two separate stages: pre-training the encoder on unlabeled datasets and fine-tuning the well-trained model on a small-scale labeled dataset. However, such two-stage approaches suffer from several shortcomings, such as the inability of unsupervised pre-training contrastive loss to directly affect downstream fine-tuning classifiers, and the lack of exploiting the classification loss which is guided by valuable ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model called SLOTS (Semi-supervised Learning fOr Time clasSification). SLOTS receives semi-labeled datasets, comprising a large number of unlabeled samples and a small proportion of labeled samples, and maps them to an embedding space through an encoder. We calculate not only the unsupervised contrastive loss but also measure the supervised contrastive loss on the samples with ground truth. The learned embeddings are fed into a classifier, and the classification loss is calculated using the available true labels. The unsupervised, supervised contrastive losses and classification loss are jointly used to optimize the encoder and classifier. We evaluate SLOTS by comparing it with ten state-of-the-art methods across five datasets. The results demonstrate that SLOTS is a simple yet effective framework. When compared to the two-stage framework, our end-to-end SLOTS utilizes the same input data, consumes a similar computational cost, but delivers significantly improved performance.

However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the importance of exploring new activities in real-world scenarios, existing human activity recognition studies generally rely on predefined known activities and often overlook detecting new patterns (novelties) that have not been previously observed during training. Novelty detection in human activities becomes even more challenging due to (1) diversity of patterns within the same known activity, (2) shared patterns between known and new activities, and (3) differences in sensor properties of each activity dataset. We introduce CLAN, a two-tower model that leverages Contrastive Learning with diverse data Augmentation for New activity detection in sensor-based environments. CLAN simultaneously and explicitly utilizes multiple types of strongly shifted data as negative samples in contrastive learning, effectively learning invariant representations that adapt to various pattern variations within the same activity. To enhance the ability to distinguish between known and new activities that share common features, CLAN incorporates both time and frequency domains, enabling the learning of multi-faceted discriminative representations. Additionally, we design an automatic selection mechanism of data augmentation methods tailored to each dataset's properties, generating appropriate positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CLAN achieves a 9.24% improvement in AUROC compared to the best-performing baseline model.</p></details> |  |

To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function. As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p></details> |  |

The ever-increasing sensorization of manufacturing lines makes processes more observable, but also poses the challenge of continuously analyzing vast amounts of multivariate time series data. These challenges include data quality since data may contain noise, be unlabeled or even mislabeled. A promising approach consists of combining an embedding model with other Machine Learning algorithms to enhance the overall performance in detecting anomalies. Moreover, representing time series as vectors brings many advantages like higher flexibility and improved ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. We tested our solution in a real industrial use case, using data collected from a Bonfiglioli plant. The results demonstrate that, unlike traditional reconstruction-based autoencoders, which often struggle in the presence of sporadic noise, our embedding-based framework maintains high performance across various noise conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies.

Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module.

This paper explores a combination of clustering methods, which we called Line Space Clustering (LSC), a representation that transforms data points into lines in a newly defined feature space, enabling clustering based on the similarity of feature value patterns, essentially treating features as sequences. LSC employs a combined distance metric that uses Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances, weighted by a parameter {\alpha}, allowing flexibility in emphasizing shape or magnitude similarities. We delve deeply into the mechanics of DTW and the Savitzky Golay filter, explaining their roles in the algorithm.

Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA).

This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of predictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of time-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several statistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy demand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of these models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on traditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of Root Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2 score (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better captures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods. The proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in smart grid systems.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows. The findings demonstrate how quantum-assisted learning can contribute to financial modeling, offering insights into the practical role of quantum resources in time-series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (31 with appendices), 6 figures (13 with appendices); submitted to UAI 2025</p></details> |

While existing transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, they mainly focus on forecasting and fail to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of MedTS data. In this paper, we introduce Sparseformer, a transformer specifically designed for MedTS classification. We propose a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global modeling and token compression, allowing dynamic focus on the most informative tokens while distilling redundant features. This mechanism is then applied to the multi-granularity, cross-channel encoding of medical signals, capturing intra- and inter-granularity correlations and inter-channel connections. The sparsification design allows our model to handle heterogeneous inputs of varying lengths and channels directly. Further, we introduce an adaptive label encoder to address label space misalignment across datasets, equipping our model with cross-dataset transferability to alleviate the medical label scarcity issue. Our model outperforms 12 baselines across seven medical datasets under supervised learning. In the few-shot learning experiments, our model also achieves superior average results. In addition, the in-domain and cross-domain experiments among three diagnostic scenarios demonstrate our model's zero-shot learning capability. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and transferability of our model in various medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 16 pages, 5 tables</p></details> |

These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state.

Motivated by insights from the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) paradigm, of which real-world data exhibits multi-scale patterns, we construct several graphs using Persistent Homology Filtration -- a mathematical framework describing the multiscale structural properties of data points. Then, we use the constructed graphs as an input to create an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks. The ensemble aggregates the signals from the individual learners via an attention-based routing mechanism, thus systematically encoding the inherent multiscale structures of data. Four different real-world experiments on seismic activity prediction and traffic forecasting (PEMS-BAY, METR-LA) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-graph baselines while providing interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |

Recent years, there are increasing interest of the data mining community to develop time series deep learning models to pursue better performance. The models performance often evaluate by certain evaluation metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-score. Yet time series data are often hard to interpret and are collected with unknown environmental factors, sensor configuration, latent physic mechanisms, and non-stationary evolving behavior. As a result, a model that is better on standard metric-based evaluation may not always perform better in real-world tasks. In this blue sky paper, we aim to explore the challenge that exists in the metric-based evaluation framework for time series data mining and propose a potential blue-sky idea -- developing a knowledge-discovery-based evaluation framework, which aims to effectively utilize domain-expertise knowledge to evaluate a model. We demonstrate that an evidence-seeking explanation can potentially have stronger persuasive power than metric-based evaluation and obtain better generalization ability for time series data mining tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in SIAM SDM 2025 - Blue Sky Track (to appear)</p></details> |

Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits.

Conventional methods typically compare motion trajectories using individual joint coordinates or velocities independently, employing techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that inherently apply temporal alignment even when such correction may distort meaningful rhythm-based differences. In contrast, our approach models the coordination dynamics as Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, leveraging convolution operations between pairs of time series data to capture the gain and phase-lag inherent in genuine coordination dynamics. Empirical validation demonstrates the robustness of the proposed metric to variations in camera angles and scaling, providing superior discriminative capability compared to DTW and deep learning-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> |

This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios generated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in under an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated data provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted technology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is inadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive expenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures.

Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13th ...</summary><p>13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

A more general approach leveraging the medical reports of clinical EEG recordings is to learn mappings between medical reports and EEG recordings. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework EEG-CLIP that aligns EEG time series and their corresponding clinical text descriptions in a shared embedding space. We investigate its potential for versatile EEG decoding, assessing performance on a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, results show that EEG-CLIP manages to nontrivially align text and EEG representations.

This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and $\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows: $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT). $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation. $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.</p></details> | 33 pages |

However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling.

This study introduces a novel deep learning framework that advances time series forecasting for infectious diseases, with its application to COVID 19 data as a critical case study. Our hybrid approach integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to capture spatial and temporal dynamics of disease transmission across diverse regions. The CNN extracts spatial features from raw epidemiological data, while the LSTM models temporal patterns, yielding precise and adaptable predictions. To maximize performance, we employ a hybrid optimization strategy combining the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) to fine tune hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. Applied to COVID 19 case data from 24 countries across six continents, our method outperforms established benchmarks, including ARIMA and standalone LSTM models, with statistically significant gains in predictive accuracy (e.g., reduced RMSE).

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent time-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination conditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR data to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute resources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023, NASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available, analysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to systematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often prohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer - which requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a per-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances when there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our model's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural disasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three different regions of the world. Across events, our approach yields high quality delineations: F1 scores exceeding 0.6 and Areas Under the Precision-Recall Curve exceeding 0.65, consistently outperforming existing SAR disturbance methods. Our findings suggest that a self-supervised vision transformer is well-suited for global disturbance mapping and can be a valuable tool for operational, near-global disturbance monitoring, particularly when labeled data does not exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18929v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18929v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, they still face substantial challenges of low communication efficiency and suboptimal task performance, making the careful design of the agents' communication topologies particularly important. Inspired by the management theory that roles in an efficient team are often dynamically adjusted, we propose AgentDropout, which identifies redundant agents and communication across different communication rounds by optimizing the adjacency matrices of the communication graphs and eliminates them to enhance both token efficiency and task performance. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, AgentDropout achieves an average reduction of 21.6% in prompt token consumption and 18.4% in completion token consumption, along with a performance improvement of 1.14 on the tasks. Furthermore, the extended experiments demonstrate that AgentDropout achieves notable domain transferability and structure robustness, revealing its reliability and effectiveness. We release our code at https://github.com/wangzx1219/AgentDropout.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory Controller Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18869v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18869v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |
| **[EconEvals: Benchmarks and Litmus Tests for LLM Agents in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18825v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18825v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop benchmarks for LLM agents that act in, learn from, and strategize in unknown environments, the specifications of which the LLM agent must learn over time from deliberate exploration. Our benchmarks consist of decision-making tasks derived from key problems in economics. To forestall saturation, the benchmark tasks are synthetically generated with scalable difficulty levels. Additionally, we propose litmus tests, a new kind of quantitative measure for LLMs and LLM agents. Unlike benchmarks, litmus tests quantify differences in character, values, and tendencies of LLMs and LLM agents, by considering their behavior when faced with tradeoffs (e.g., efficiency versus equality) where there is no objectively right or wrong behavior. Overall, our benchmarks and litmus tests assess the abilities and tendencies of LLM agents in tackling complex economic problems in diverse settings spanning procurement, scheduling, task allocation, and pricing -- applications that should grow in importance as such agents are further integrated into the economy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classical Planning with LLM-Generated Heuristics: Challenging the State of the Art with Python Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18809v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18809v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems. However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, a comprehensive understanding of their real-world applications remains limited. To address this, we introduce REALM, a dataset of over 94,000 LLM use cases collected from Reddit and news articles. REALM captures two key dimensions: the diverse applications of LLMs and the demographics of their users. It categorizes LLM applications and explores how users' occupations relate to the types of applications they use. By integrating real-world data, REALM offers insights into LLM adoption across different domains, providing a foundation for future research on their evolving societal roles.

| **[BitDecoding: Unlocking Tensor Cores for Long-Context LLMs Decoding with Low-Bit KV Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18773v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18773v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even 2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs. However, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV cache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and dequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this work, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor Cores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of KV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these challenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data layout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally, BitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a fine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and improving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves up to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to FP16 FlashDecoding-v2. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV cache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K sequence length, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-context generation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/DD-DuDa/BitDecoding.</p></details> |  |

However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Post-Training Quantization in LLMs: Comprehensive Taxonomy, Unified Evaluation, and Comparative Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13178v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.13178v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training Quantization (PTQ) technique has been extensively adopted for large language models (LLMs) compression owing to its efficiency and low resource requirement. However, current research lacks a in-depth analysis of the superior and applicable scenarios of each PTQ strategy. In addition, existing algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off among model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these confusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly, in order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for existing mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies (e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct extensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with various sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1), architectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and VILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluation metrics.Through comparative analysis on the results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and modelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our benchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding cross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models should be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical combination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various robustness. We believe that our benchmark will provide valuable recommendations for the deployment of LLMs and future research on PTQ approaches.We conduct an repository for our benchmark at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ_Benchmark.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 fugures |
| **[AgentSpec: Customizable Runtime Enforcement for Safe and Reliable LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18666v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18666v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Much Knowledge Can You Pack into a LoRA Adapter without Harming LLM?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14502v3)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.14502v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on many tasks is greatly limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training and stored in the model's parameters. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular and efficient training technique for updating or domain-specific adaptation of LLMs. In this study, we investigate how new facts can be incorporated into the LLM using LoRA without compromising the previously learned knowledge. We fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-instruct using LoRA with varying amounts of new knowledge. Our experiments have shown that the best results are obtained when the training data contains a mixture of known and new facts. However, this approach is still potentially harmful because the model's performance on external question-answering benchmarks declines after such fine-tuning. When the training data is biased towards certain entities, the model tends to regress to few overrepresented answers. In addition, we found that the model becomes more confident and refuses to provide an answer in only few cases. These findings highlight the potential pitfalls of LoRA-based LLM updates and underscore the importance of training data composition and tuning parameters to balance new knowledge integration and general model capabilities.</p></details> |  |

The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%). The code will be released soon.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

We design and evaluate test cases across different real-world environments, analyzing the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting spatial layouts, handling user constraints, and planning efficient routes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for supporting personalized indoor navigation, with an average of 50.54% correct indications and a maximum of 77.78%. The results do not appear to depend on the complexity of the layout or the complexity of the expected path, but rather on the number of points of interest and the abundance of visual information, which negatively affect the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research directions.

Most existing studies focus on judging the final answer at the problem level, while they ignore detailed feedback on each step in a math problem-solving process, which requires abilities of semantic understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to boost large language model (LLM) for step-level automatic math correction, named StepAMC. Particularly, we convert the step-level automatic math correction within the text classification task into an RL problem to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Then, we design a space-constrained policy network to improve the stability of RL. Then, we introduce a fine-grained reward network to convert the binary human feedback into a continuous value. We conduct extensive experiments over two benchmark datasets and the results show that our model outperforms the eleven strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, the causal hallucinations between a step of reasoning and corresponding state transitions are becoming a significant obstacle to advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, especially in long-range reasoning tasks. This paper proposes a non-chain-based reasoning framework for simultaneous consideration of causal significance and consistency, i.e., the Causal Significance and Consistency Enhancer (CSCE). We customize LLM's loss function utilizing treatment effect assessments to enhance its reasoning ability from two aspects: causal significance and consistency. This ensures that the model captures essential causal relationships and maintains robust and consistent performance across various scenarios. Additionally, we transform the reasoning process from the cascading multiple one-step reasoning commonly used in Chain-Based methods, like CoT, to a causal-enhanced method that outputs the entire reasoning process in one go, further improving the model's reasoning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method improves both the reasoning success rate and speed. These improvements further demonstrate that non-chain-based methods can also aid LLMs in completing reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,4 figures.

To address this issue, researchers have sought to apply network pruning techniques to LLMs. A critical challenge in pruning is allocation the sparsity for each layer. Recent sparsity allocation methods is often based on heuristics or search that can easily lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we conducted an extensive investigation into various LLMs and revealed three significant discoveries: (1) the layerwise pruning sensitivity (LPS) of LLMs is highly non-uniform, (2) the choice of pruning metric affects LPS, and (3) the performance of a sparse model is related to the uniformity of its layerwise redundancy level. Based on these observations, we propose that the layerwise sparsity of LLMs should adhere to three principles: \emph{non-uniformity}, \emph{pruning metric dependency}, and \emph{uniform layerwise redundancy level} in the pruned model. To this end, we proposed Maximum Redundancy Pruning (MRP), an iterative pruning algorithm that prunes in the most redundant layers (\emph{i.e.}, those with the highest non-outlier ratio) at each iteration. The achieved layerwise sparsity aligns with the outlined principles. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available LLMs, including the LLaMA2 and OPT, across various benchmarks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of MRP, demonstrating its superiority over previous methods.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we assess the instruction quality from a unique perspective termed \textbf{Writing Manner}, which encompasses the selection of vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure to convey specific semantics. We argue that there exists a substantial writing manner gap between the visual instructions and the base Large Language Models (LLMs) within LMMs. This gap forces the pre-trained base LLMs to deviate from their original writing styles, leading to capability degradation of both base LLMs and LMMs. To bridge the writing manner gap while preserving the original semantics, we propose directly leveraging the base LLM to align the writing manner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the base LLM itself, resulting in novel LLM-aligned instructions. The manual writing manner evaluation results demonstrate that our approach successfully minimizes the writing manner gap. By utilizing LLM-aligned instructions, the baseline models LLaVA-7B and QwenVL demonstrate enhanced resistance to hallucinations and non-trivial comprehensive improvements across all $15$ visual and language benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

As attack techniques grow increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, the arms race between cyber defenders and attackers continues to intensify. The revolutionary impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up numerous opportunities in various fields, including cybersecurity. An intriguing question arises: can the extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs be harnessed for provenance analysis and play a positive role in identifying previously unknown malicious events? To seek a deeper understanding of this issue, we propose a new strategy for taking advantage of LLMs in provenance-based threat detection. In our design, the state-of-the-art LLM offers additional details in provenance data interpretation, leveraging their knowledge of system calls, software identity, and high-level understanding of application execution context. The advanced contextualized embedding capability is further utilized to capture the rich semantics of event descriptions. We comprehensively examine the quality of the resulting embeddings, and it turns out that they offer promising avenues. Subsequently, machine learning models built upon these embeddings demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world data. In our evaluation, supervised threat detection achieves a precision of 99.0%, and semi-supervised anomaly detection attains a precision of 96.9%.</p></details> |  |

A Live Arena Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18313v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18313v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains, but their effectiveness in financial decision making, particularly in fund investment, remains inadequately evaluated. Current benchmarks primarily assess LLMs understanding of financial documents rather than their ability to manage assets or analyze trading opportunities in dynamic market conditions. A critical limitation in existing evaluation methodologies is the backtesting approach, which suffers from information leakage when LLMs are evaluated on historical data they may have encountered during pretraining. This paper introduces DeepFund, a comprehensive platform for evaluating LLM based trading strategies in a simulated live environment. Our approach implements a multi agent framework where LLMs serve as both analysts and managers, creating a realistic simulation of investment decision making. The platform employs a forward testing methodology that mitigates information leakage by evaluating models on market data released after their training cutoff dates. We provide a web interface that visualizes model performance across different market conditions and investment parameters, enabling detailed comparative analysis. Through DeepFund, we aim to provide a more accurate and fair assessment of LLMs capabilities in fund investment, offering insights into their potential real world applications in financial markets.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Code Translation in Repository Context via Triple Knowledge-Augmented](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18305v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18305v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have behaved well in function-level code translation without repository-level context. However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development. First, K-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness. The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution. Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p></details> |  |

Our findings indicate that LLMs are more effective at assessing claims in national or international news stories than in local news stories, better at evaluating static information than dynamic information, and better at verifying true claims compared to false ones. We hypothesize that this disparity arises because the former types of claims are better represented in the training data. Additionally, we find that incorporating retrieved results from a search engine in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setting significantly reduces the number of claims an LLM cannot assess. However, this approach also increases the occurrence of incorrect assessments, partly due to irrelevant or low-quality search results. This diagnostic study highlights the need for future research on fact-checking machine-generated reports to prioritize improving the precision and relevance of retrieved information to better support fact-checking efforts. Furthermore, claims about dynamic events and local news may require human-in-the-loop fact-checking systems to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p></details> |  |

To lower costs, maximizing the request batch size by managing GPU memory efficiently is crucial. While PagedAttention has recently been proposed to improve the efficiency of memory management, we find that the growing heterogeneity in the embeddings dimensions, attention, and access patterns of modern LLM architectures introduces new challenges for memory allocation. In this paper, we present Jenga, a novel memory allocation framework for heterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1) minimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes, and (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the specific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level memory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes to optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching logic to enhance memory reuse. We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and evaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations. Evaluations show that Jenga improves GPU memory utilization by up to 79.6%, and increases serving throughput by up to 4.92x (1.80x on average).</p></details> | 16 pages, 19 figures |

Thus, understanding Islamophobia's global spread and online dissemination is crucial. This paper performs a large-scale analysis of specialized, semi-coded Islamophobic terms such as (muzrat, pislam, mudslime, mohammedan, muzzies) floated on extremist social platforms, i.e., 4Chan, Gab, Telegram, etc. First, we use large language models (LLMs) to show their ability to understand these terms. Second, using Google Perspective API, we also find that Islamophobic text is more toxic compared to other kinds of hate speech. Finally, we use BERT topic modeling approach to extract different topics and Islamophobic discourse on these social platforms. Our findings indicate that LLMs understand these Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) slurs; however, measures are still required to control such discourse. Our topic modeling also indicates that Islamophobic text is found across various political, conspiratorial, and far-right movements and is particularly directed against Muslim immigrants. Taken altogether, we performed the first study on Islamophobic semi-coded terms and shed a global light on Islamophobia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15299v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15299v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.</p></details> |  |

However, setting up such simulations requires expertise in defining geometry, generating meshes, establishing boundary conditions, and configuring solvers. This research aims to simplify this process by enabling engineers to describe their setup in plain language, allowing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the necessary input files for their specific application. This novel approach allows establishing a direct link between natural language and complex engineering tasks. Building on previous work that evaluated various LLMs for generating input files across simple and complex geometries, this study demonstrates that small LLMs - specifically, Phi-3 Mini and Qwen-2.5 1.5B - can be fine-tuned to generate precise engineering geometries in GMSH format. Through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we curated a dataset of 480 instruction-output pairs encompassing simple shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, and half circles) and more complex structures (I-beams, cylindrical pipes, and bent pipes). The fine-tuned models produced high-fidelity outputs, handling routine geometry generation with minimal intervention. While challenges remain with geometries involving combinations of multiple bodies, this study demonstrates that fine-tuned small models can outperform larger models like GPT-4o in specialised tasks, offering a precise and resource-efficient alternative for engineering applications.</p></details> | 24 pages, 17 figures |

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.</p></details> |  |

However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Answer Bench (DNA Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNA Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNA Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning can be achieved by solving a series of independent and self-contained subquestions. These subquestions are essentially \textit{atomic questions}, exhibiting the memoryless property similar to Markov processes. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (\our), where each state transition consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a simplified question that maintains answer equivalence with the original problem. This answer preservation enables the iterative \textit{decomposition-contraction} process to naturally form a meaningful Markov reasoning process. Furthermore, these atomic states can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling \our to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of \our both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, \our achieves an \textbf{80.6\%} F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by \textbf{3.4\%} and DeepSeek-R1 by \textbf{10.6\%}.

Despite its widespread use in clinical practice, it is limited by subjectivity and a lack of precision. While recent deep learning-based approaches have consistently improved classification accuracies, they often lack interpretability, hindering their utility in clinical decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AGIR, a novel pipeline consisting of a pre-trained VQ-VAE motion tokenizer and a subsequent Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned over pairs of motion tokens and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasonings. To fine-tune an LLM for pathological gait analysis, we first introduce a multimodal dataset by adding rationales dedicated to MDS-UPDRS gait score assessment to an existing PD gait dataset. We then introduce a two-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy to enhance the LLM's motion comprehension with pathology-specific knowledge. This strategy includes: 1) a generative stage that aligns gait motions with analytic descriptions through bidirectional motion-description generation, 2) a reasoning stage that integrates logical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for impairment assessment with UPDRS gait score. Validation on an existing dataset and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods confirm the robustness and accuracy of our pipeline, demonstrating its ability to assign gait impairment scores from motion input with clinically meaningful rationales.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark comprises tasks across four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test hallucination rejection. We develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference implementations. Results show Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o achieve the best overall performance, with Claude models excelling on solvable tasks while OpenAI models better identify unsolvable scenarios. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming substantially more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms.

It is an important task since it provides feedback signals to learners, and it has been demonstrated that timely feedback improves the learning process. In recent years, the irruption of LLMs has shed light on the effectiveness of automatic grading. In this paper, we explore the performance of different LLMs and prompting techniques in automatically grading short-text answers to open-ended questions. Unlike most of the literature, our study focuses on a use case where the questions, answers, and prompts are all in Spanish. Experimental results comparing automatic scores to those of human-expert evaluators show good outcomes in terms of accuracy, precision and consistency for advanced LLMs, both open and proprietary. Results are notably sensitive to prompt styles, suggesting biases toward certain words or content in the prompt. However, the best combinations of models and prompt strategies, consistently surpasses an accuracy of 95% in a three-level grading task, which even rises up to more than 98% when the it is simplified to a binary right or wrong rating problem, which demonstrates the potential that LLMs have to implement this type of automation in education applications.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical question remains: Do these mathematical reasoning abilities persist when LLMs are presented with culturally adapted math problems? Specifically, how do LLMs perform when faced with math problems embedded in cultural contexts that have no significant representation in main stream web-scale AI training data? To explore this, we generated six synthetic cultural datasets from GSM8K, a widely used benchmark for assessing LLMs' mathematical reasoning skills. While preserving the mathematical logic and numerical values of the original GSM8K test set, we modify cultural elements such as personal names, food items, place names, etc. These culturally adapted datasets provide a more reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' mathematical reasoning under shifting cultural contexts. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with math problems when cultural references change, even though the underlying mathematical structure remains constant. Smaller models exhibit greater performance drops compared to larger models. Interestingly, our results also suggest that cultural familiarity can enhance mathematical reasoning. Even models with no explicit mathematical training but exposure to relevant cultural contexts sometimes outperform larger, mathematically proficient models on culturally embedded math problems. This study highlights the impact of cultural context on the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, underscoring the need for more diverse and representative training data to improve robustness in real-world applications.

Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem. However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM. Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism. Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability. On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p></details> |  |

This capability allows for the generation of diverse images that convey highly complex visual concepts. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating new images from text-image pairs and struggle to produce fine-grained animations from existing images and textual guidance without fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce LASER, a tuning-free LLM-driven attention control framework that follows a progressive process: LLM planning, feature-attention injection, and stable animation generation. LASER leverages a large language model (LLM) to refine general descriptions into fine-grained prompts, guiding pre-trained text-to-image models to generate aligned keyframes with subtle variations. The LLM also generates control signals for feature and attention injections, enabling seamless text-guided image morphing for various transformations without additional fine-tuning. By using the same initial noise inversion from the input image, LASER receives LLM-controlled injections during denoising and leverages interpolated text embeddings to produce a series of coherent animation frames. We propose a Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation Benchmark to validate the effectiveness and efficacy of LASER. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LASER achieves impressive results in consistent and efficient animation generation, establishing it as a powerful tool for producing detailed animations and opening new avenues in digital content creation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike robots, humans navigate not only through spatial awareness and physical distances but also by integrating external information, such as elevator maintenance updates from public notification boards and experiential knowledge, like the need for special access through certain doors. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which possesses text understanding and intelligence close to human performance, there is now an opportunity to infuse robot navigation systems with a level of understanding akin to human cognition. In this study, we propose using osmAG (Area Graph in OpensStreetMap textual format), an innovative semantic topometric hierarchical map representation, to bridge the gap between the capabilities of ROS move_base and the contextual understanding offered by LLMs. Our methodology employs LLMs as an actual copilot in robot navigation, enabling the integration of a broader range of informational inputs while maintaining the robustness of traditional robotic navigation systems.

However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents.

Notably, LLMs like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in text-to-code generation tasks. However, the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation necessitates a critical examination of the safety implications associated with their outputs. Existing research efforts have primarily focused on verifying the functional correctness of LLMs, overlooking their safety in code generation. This paper introduces a jailbreaking approach, CodeJailbreaker, designed to uncover safety concerns in LLM-based code generation. The basic observation is that existing safety mechanisms for LLMs are built through the instruction-following paradigm, where malicious intent is explicitly articulated within the instruction of the prompt. Consequently, CodeJailbreaker explores to construct a prompt whose instruction is benign and the malicious intent is implicitly encoded in a covert channel, i.e., the commit message, to bypass the safety mechanism. Experiments on the recently-released RMCBench benchmark demonstrate that CodeJailbreaker markedly surpasses the conventional jailbreaking strategy, which explicitly conveys malicious intents in the instructions, in terms of the attack effectiveness across three code generation tasks. This study challenges the traditional safety paradigms in LLM-based code generation, emphasizing the need for enhanced safety measures in safeguarding against implicit malicious cues.</p></details> |  |

However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code analysis, prevailing evaluation methodologies often lack the \textbf{context-aware robustness} necessary to capture real-world intricacies and cross-component interactions. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{VulnSage}, a comprehensive evaluation framework and a dataset curated from diverse, large-scale open-source system software projects developed in C/C++. Unlike prior datasets, it leverages a heuristic noise pre-filtering approach combined with LLM-based reasoning to ensure a representative and minimally noisy spectrum of vulnerabilities. The framework supports multi-granular analysis across function, file, and inter-function levels and employs four diverse zero-shot prompt strategies: Baseline, Chain-of-Thought, Think, and Think & Verify. Through this evaluation, we uncover that structured reasoning prompts substantially improve LLM performance, with Think & Verify reducing ambiguous responses from 20.3% to 9.1% while increasing accuracy. We further demonstrate that code-specialized models consistently outperform general-purpose alternatives, with performance varying significantly across vulnerability types, revealing that no single approach universally excels across all security contexts.

In practice, such "harmlessness" behavior is mainly achieved by training models to reject harmful requests, such as "Explain how to burn down my neighbor's house", where the model appropriately declines to respond. However, this approach can inadvertently result in false refusal, where models reject benign queries as well, such as "Tell me how to kill a Python process". In this work, we demonstrate that prompting safety reflection before generating a response can mitigate false refusal behavior. Building on this finding, we introduce the Think-Before-Refusal (TBR) schema and conduct safety-aware instruction fine-tuning incorporating safety reflection. In an ablation study across 15 pre-trained models, we show that models fine-tuned with safety reflection significantly reduce false refusal behavior while maintaining safety and overall performance compared to those fine-tuned without safety reflection.</p></details> | 18 pages, 23 figures |

But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by deliberative democracy, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |

Existing scheduling frameworks mainly target at latency optimization while neglecting the capability of LLMs to serve different level of queries, which could lead to computational resource waste. For example, those simple queries can be safely handled by small, fast and cheap LLMs, while those complex and difficult queries need to be handled by large, slow, and expensive LLMs. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing an efficient capability-cost coordinated scheduling framework, ECCOS, for multi-LLM serving, which explicitly constrains response quality and workload to optimize LLM inference cost. Specifically, it introduces the two-stage scheduling by designing a multi-objective predictor and a constrained optimizer. The predictor estimates both model capabilities and computational costs through training-based and retrieval-based approaches, while the optimizer determines cost-optimal assignments under quality and workload constraints. It also introduces QAServe, a dataset for sample-wise response quality and costs collected by zero-shot prompting different LLMs on knowledge QA and mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECCOS improves success rates by 6.30% while reducing costs by 10.15% compared to existing methods, consuming less than 0.5% of LLM response time. The code is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/ECCOS, and the proposed smart routing mechanism has been integrated into AIOS, the AI Agent Operating System, at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.</p></details> |  |

In this situation, utilizing self-generated synthetic data has become crucial for fine-tuning LLMs without extensive human annotation. However, current methods often fail to ensure consistent improvements across iterations, with performance stagnating after only minimal updates. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization (DNPO). DNPO employs a dynamic sample labeling mechanism to construct preference pairs for training and introduces controlled, trainable noise into the preference optimization process. Our approach effectively prevents stagnation and enables continuous improvement. In experiments with Zephyr-7B, DNPO consistently outperforms existing methods, showing an average performance boost of 2.6% across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DNPO shows a significant improvement in model-generated data quality, with a 29.4% win-loss rate gap compared to the baseline in GPT-4 evaluations. This highlights its effectiveness in enhancing model performance through iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we proposed efficient weighted-loss approaches to align synthetic data with real-world distribution by emphasizing high-quality and diversified data generated by LLMs with using merely a little real-world data. We empirically assessed the effectiveness of our method on multiple text classification tasks, and the results showed leveraging our approaches on a BERT-level model robustly outperformed standard cross-entropy and other data weighting approaches, providing potential solutions to effectively leveraging synthetic data from any suitable data generator for model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera ready</p></details> |

Many attempts have been released in the open source community to break the trade-off between performance and efficiency, such as the Qwen Coder series and the DeepSeek Coder series. This paper introduces yet another attempt in this area, namely Ling-Coder-Lite. We leverage the efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture along with a set of high-quality data curation methods (especially those based on program analytics) to build an efficient yet powerful code LLM. Ling-Coder-Lite exhibits on-par performance on 12 representative coding benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art models of similar size, such as Qwen2.5-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite, while offering competitive latency and throughput.

As LLM Agents are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we utilize LLM Agents' systematic hallucinations to mirror human cognitive biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents' social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, the CogMir framework demonstrates its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social intelligence of LLM Agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, vastly different features between C and Rust--e.g., distinct definitions and usages of pointers and references--pose significant challenges beyond mere syntactic translation. Existing automated translation tools, such as C2Rust, may rely too much on syntactic, template-based translation and generate unsafe Rust code that is hard for human developers to read, maintain, or even compile. More semantic-aware translation that produces safer, idiomatic, and runnable Rust code is much needed. This paper introduces a novel dependency-guided and large language model (LLM)-based C-to-Rust translation approach, RustMap, based on three key ideas: (1) Utilize LLM capabilities to produce idiomatic Rust code from given small pieces of C code, (2) Mitigate LLM limitations in handling large codebases by breaking project-scale C programs into smaller units for translation according to their usage dependencies and composing them into a runnable Rust program, and (3) Enhance the correctness of the translated Rust program by using test cases to check input/output equivalence, isolate faulty code when execution states deviate, and iteratively refine the translation using feedback from compilation and test errors. We empirically evaluate RustMap on 126 real-world programs, including 125 from Rosetta Code and a 7000+ line bzip2 implementation using GPT-4o as the LLM. RustMap shows promising results, guiding GPT-4o to produce idiomatic, readable, and functional Rust code with significantly less unsafe code than other tools, and revealing non-trivial translation patterns reusable for future research.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

However, distilled models do not match the effectiveness of their teacher LLMs. We hypothesize that this effectiveness gap is due to the fact that previous work has not applied the best-suited methods for fine-tuning cross-encoders on manually labeled data (e.g., hard-negative sampling, deep sampling, and listwise loss functions). To close this gap, we create a new dataset, Rank-DistiLLM. Cross-encoders trained on Rank-DistiLLM achieve the effectiveness of LLMs while being up to 173 times faster and 24 times more memory efficient.

In this work, we identify two key challenges contributing to this inefficiency: $\textit{over-exploration}$ due to redundant states with semantically equivalent content, and $\textit{under-exploration}$ caused by high variance in verifier scoring leading to frequent trajectory switching. To address these issues, we propose FETCH, an e$\textbf{f}$fici$\textbf{e}$nt $\textbf{t}$ree sear$\textbf{ch}$ framework, which is a flexible, plug-and-play system compatible with various tree search algorithms. Our framework mitigates over-exploration by merging semantically similar states using agglomerative clustering of text embeddings obtained from a fine-tuned SimCSE model. To tackle under-exploration, we enhance verifiers by incorporating temporal difference learning with adjusted $\lambda$-returns during training to reduce variance, and employing a verifier ensemble to aggregate scores during inference. Experiments on GSM8K, GSM-Plus, and MATH datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly improve reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across four different tree search algorithms, paving the way for more practical applications of LLM-based reasoning.

Many LLM inference tasks rely on the same base model (e.g., LoRA). To leverage this, PipeBoost introduces fault-tolerant pipeline parallelism across both model loading and inference stages. This approach maximizes aggregate PCIe bandwidth and parallel computation across GPUs, enabling faster generation of the first token. PipeBoost also introduces recovery techniques that enable uninterrupted inference services by utilizing the shared advantages of multiple GPUs. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art low-latency LLM serving systems, PipeBoost reduces inference latency by 31% to 49.8%. For certain models (e.g., OPT-1.3B), PipeBoost achieves cold-start latencies in the range of a few hundred microseconds.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing frameworks fail to address the key step of producing output suitable for broader dissemination to the general public: while human fact-checkers communicate their findings through fact-checking articles, automated systems typically produce little or no justification for their assessments. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. We argue for the need to extend the typical automatic fact-checking pipeline with automatic generation of full fact-checking articles. We first identify key desiderata for such articles through a series of interviews with experts from leading fact-checking organizations. We then develop QRAFT, an LLM-based agentic framework that mimics the writing workflow of human fact-checkers. Finally, we assess the practical usefulness of QRAFT through human evaluations with professional fact-checkers. Our evaluation shows that while QRAFT outperforms several previously proposed text-generation approaches, it lags considerably behind expert-written articles.

However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we introduce OmniScience, a specialized large reasoning model for general science, developed through three key components: (1) domain adaptive pretraining on a carefully curated corpus of scientific literature, (2) instruction tuning on a specialized dataset to guide the model in following domain-specific tasks, and (3) reasoning-based knowledge distillation through fine-tuning to significantly enhance its ability to generate contextually relevant and logically sound responses. We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts.

However, this approach significantly increases computational costs, both monetarily and environmentally. The widely-used self-consistency method further exacerbates these costs by aggregating multiple reasoning paths to improve accuracy, often requiring between 40 to 64 samples per task. Although aggregation effectively reduces variance and bias, additional sampling can lead to diminishing returns when early samples yield consistent results. To address inefficiencies, we propose leveraging Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT) to dynamically terminate sampling once sufficient consistency is achieved. We calibrate SPRT parameters specifically for LLM applications, accounting for sensitivity to detect the mode of the distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating SPRT significantly enhances token efficiency, achieving comparable accuracy to self-consistency methods but at a substantially reduced computational cost.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM-based code generation primarily focus on functional correctness while overlooking hardware resource usage. Furthermore, current benchmarks offer limited diversity and do not fully represent the wide range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-focused benchmark explicitly designed to distinguish between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL code. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our open-source evaluation framework automatically tests LLMs by generating Verilog code, verifying correctness, and measuring resource usage. The experiments, which primarily analyze Lookup Table (LUT) usage, reveal significant differences among LLMs, demonstrating ResBench's capability to identify models that generate more resource-optimized FPGA designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in International Symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies 2025</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Human Production-Interpretation Asymmetries to Test LLM Cognitive Plausibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17579v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17579v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whether large language models (LLMs) process language similarly to humans has been the subject of much theoretical and practical debate. We examine this question through the lens of the production-interpretation distinction found in human sentence processing and evaluate the extent to which instruction-tuned LLMs replicate this distinction. Using an empirically documented asymmetry between production and interpretation in humans for implicit causality verbs as a testbed, we find that some LLMs do quantitatively and qualitatively reflect human-like asymmetries between production and interpretation. We demonstrate that whether this behavior holds depends upon both model size - with larger models more likely to reflect human-like patterns and the choice of meta-linguistic prompts used to elicit the behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness-Driven LLM-based Causal Discovery with Active Learning and Dynamic Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17569v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17569v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in numerous scientific fields by clarifying the causal relationships that underlie phenomena observed in diverse disciplines. Despite significant advancements in CD algorithms that enhance bias and fairness analyses in machine learning, their application faces challenges due to the high computational demands and complexities of large-scale data. This paper introduces a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for CD, utilizing a metadata-based approach akin to the reasoning processes of human experts. By shifting from pairwise queries to a more scalable breadth-first search (BFS) strategy, the number of required queries is reduced from quadratic to linear in terms of variable count, thereby addressing scalability concerns inherent in previous approaches. This method utilizes an Active Learning (AL) and a Dynamic Scoring Mechanism that prioritizes queries based on their potential information gain, combining mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence scores to refine the causal graph more efficiently and accurately. This BFS query strategy reduces the required number of queries significantly, thereby addressing scalability concerns inherent in previous approaches. This study provides a more scalable and efficient solution for leveraging LLMs in fairness-driven CD, highlighting the effects of the different parameters on performance. We perform fairness analyses on the inferred causal graphs, identifying direct and indirect effects of sensitive attributes on outcomes. A comparison of these analyses against those from graphs produced by baseline methods highlights the importance of accurate causal graph construction in understanding bias and ensuring fairness in machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |

We argue that LLMs can make this process more accessible to linguists because of their capacity to follow natural-language instructions. We investigate the effectiveness of a retrieval-based LLM prompting approach to glossing, applied to the seven languages from the SIGMORPHON 2023 shared task. Our system beats the BERT-based shared task baseline for every language in the morpheme-level score category, and we show that a simple 3-best oracle has higher word-level scores than the challenge winner (a tuned sequence model) in five languages. In a case study on Tsez, we ask the LLM to automatically create and follow linguistic instructions, reducing errors on a confusing grammatical feature. Our results thus demonstrate the potential contributions which LLMs can make in interactive systems for glossing, both in making suggestions to human annotators and following directions.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA), an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing radiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA integrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning system, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local infrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA using a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in 20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and optimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations. The 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving approximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach outperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated convergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and reinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified 0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This proof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally hosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a commercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction through interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and privacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical implementation and workflow improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, preprint</p></details> |

Existing approaches primarily rely on fine-tuning-based methods, which can be categorized into gradient ascent-based (GA-based) and suppression-based methods. However, they often degrade model utility (the ability to respond to normal prompts). In this work, we aim to develop a general framework that enhances the utility of fine-tuning-based unlearning methods. To achieve this goal, we first investigate the common property between GA-based and suppression-based methods. We unveil that GA-based methods unlearn by distinguishing the target data (i.e., the data to be removed) and suppressing related generations, which is essentially the same strategy employed by suppression-based methods. Inspired by this finding, we introduce Gated Representation UNlearning (GRUN) which has two components: a soft gate function for distinguishing target data and a suppression module using Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) to adjust representations rather than model parameters. Experiments show that GRUN significantly improves the unlearning and utility. Meanwhile, it is general for fine-tuning-based methods, efficient and promising for sequential unlearning.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the role of LLMs for different code analysis tasks, focusing on three key aspects: 1) what they can analyze and their applications, 2) what models are used and 3) what datasets are used, and the challenges they face. Regarding the goal of this research, we investigate scholarly articles that explore the use of LLMs for source code analysis to uncover research developments, current trends, and the intellectual structure of this emerging field.

Although the importance of initial variance control has been well documented in neural networks in general, the literature on initialization and management of its growth during LLM pre-training, specifically, is somewhat sparse. In this paper, we introduce the Layer Index Rescaling (LIR) weight initialization scheme, and the Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) variance control strategy. Experiments on a 1B parameter LLaMA model demonstrate that better variance management using these techniques yields substantial improvements in downstream task performance (up to 4.6% on common pre-training benchmarks) and reduces extreme activation values, thus mitigating challenges associated with quantization and low-precision training.

Speak Ease combines automatic speech recognition (ASR), context-aware LLM-based outputs, and personalized text-to-speech technologies to enable more personalized, natural-sounding, and expressive communication. Through an exploratory feasibility study and focus group evaluation with speech and language pathologists (SLPs), we assessed Speak Ease's potential to enable expressivity in AAC. The findings highlight the priorities and needs of AAC users and the system's ability to enhance user expressivity by supporting more personalized and contextually relevant communication. This work provides insights into the use of multimodal inputs and LLM-driven features to improve AAC systems and support expressivity.</p></details> |  |

Traditional inference time scaling methods utilize scalar reward signals from process reward models to evaluate candidate reasoning steps, but these scalar rewards lack the nuanced qualitative information essential for understanding and justifying each step. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time scaling approach -- stepwise natural language self-critique (PANEL), which employs self-generated natural language critiques as feedback to guide the step-level search process. By generating rich, human-readable critiques for each candidate reasoning step, PANEL retains essential qualitative information, facilitating better-informed decision-making during inference. This approach bypasses the need for task-specific verifiers and the associated training overhead, making it broadly applicable across diverse tasks. Experimental results on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME and GPQA, demonstrate that PANEL significantly enhances reasoning performance, outperforming traditional scalar reward-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/puddingyeah/PANEL to support and encourage future research in this promising field.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches primarily focus on improving the quality of correct training data, e.g., distilling high-quality correct solutions from advanced models, neglecting the value contained in error data, potentially hindering the model's reflective ability. Though some studies attempt to leverage error data, they often involve complex mechanisms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore error nodes. In this work, we propose to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability by Learning from Errors for Mathematical Advancement (LEMMA). LEMMA constructs data consisting of an incorrect solution with an erroneous step and a reflection connection to a correct solution for fine-tuning. Specifically, we systematically analyze the model-generated error types and introduce an error-type grounded mistake augmentation method to collect diverse and representative errors. Correct solutions are either from fixing the errors or generating a fresh start. Through a model-aware smooth reflection connection, the erroneous solution is transferred to the correct one. By fine-tuning on the constructed dataset, the model is able to self-correct errors autonomously within the generation process without relying on external critique models. Experimental results demonstrate that LEMMA achieves significant performance improvements over other strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, under review</p></details> |

However, these models are resource-intensive, demanding substantial memory and computational power. To address this, we propose a cost-effective solution that filters conversational snippets of interest for LLM processing, tailored to the target downstream application, rather than processing every snippet. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages knowledge distillation from LLMs to develop an intent-based filter for multi-party conversations, optimized for compute power constrained environments. Our method combines different strategies to create a diverse multi-party conversational dataset, that is annotated with the target intents and is then used to fine-tune the MobileBERT model for multi-label intent classification. This model achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, effectively filtering conversation snippets based on their intents. By passing only the relevant snippets to the LLM for further processing, our approach significantly reduces overall operational costs depending on the intents and the data distribution as demonstrated in our experiments.</p></details> |  |

Nowadays, various code-checking frameworks provide extensive checker customization interfaces to meet this need. However, both the abstract checking logic and the complex API usage of large-scale checker frameworks make this task challenging. To this end, automated code checker generation is anticipated to ease the burden of checker development. In this paper, we propose AutoChecker, an innovative LLM-powered approach that can write code checkers automatically based on only a rule description and a test suite. To achieve comprehensive checking logic, AutoChecker incrementally updates the checker's logic by focusing on solving one selected case each time. To obtain precise API knowledge, during each iteration, it leverages fine-grained logic-guided API-context retrieval, where it first decomposes the checking logic into a series of sub-operations and then retrieves checker-related API-contexts for each sub-operation. For evaluation, we apply AutoChecker, five baselines, and three ablation methods using multiple LLMs to generate checkers for 20 randomly selected PMD rules. Experimental results show that AutoChecker significantly outperforms others across all effectiveness metrics, with an average test pass rate of 82.28%. Additionally, the checkers generated by AutoChecker can be successfully applied to real-world projects, matching the performance of official checkers.</p></details> |  |

While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only an 8% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content.</p></details> | Preprint |

Beyond NLP, LLMs are increasingly used in software development tasks, such as code completion, modification, bug fixing, and code translation. Software engineers widely use tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q, streamlining workflows and automating tasks with high accuracy. While the resource and energy intensity of LLM training is often highlighted, inference can be even more resource-intensive over time, as it's a continuous process with a high number of invocations. Therefore, developing resource-efficient alternatives for LLM inference is crucial for sustainability. This work proposes GREEN-CODE, a framework for energy-aware code generation in LLMs. GREEN-CODE performs dynamic early exit during LLM inference. We train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that learns to balance the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. Our approach is evaluated on two open-source LLMs, Llama 3.2 3B and OPT 2.7B, using the JavaCorpus and PY150 datasets. Results show that our method reduces the energy consumption between 23-50 % on average for code generation tasks without significantly affecting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission in ACM/IEEE conference, 11 pages</p></details> |

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of literature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two components: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing a literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective LLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step search strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the abstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying an external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking mechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized recall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the LLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step approach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in the plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based literature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a protocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set contamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to promote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical results suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature reviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and planning.

Poor or inconsistent choices can lead to increased technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and even catastrophic failures in safety-critical systems. As Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasing role in code generation, it is essential to understand how they make these decisions. However, little is known about their preferences when selecting programming languages and libraries for different coding tasks. To fill this gap, this study provides the first in-depth investigation into LLM preferences for programming languages and libraries used when generating code. We assess the preferences of eight diverse LLMs by prompting them to complete various coding tasks, including widely-studied benchmarks and the more practical task of generating the initial structural code for new projects (a crucial step that often determines a project's language or library choices). Our findings reveal that LLMs heavily favour Python when solving language-agnostic problems, using it in 90%-97% of cases for benchmark tasks. Even when generating initial project code where Python is not a suitable language, it remains the most-used language in 58% of instances. Moreover, LLMs contradict their own language recommendations in 83% of project initialisation tasks, raising concerns about their reliability in guiding language selection. Similar biases toward well-established libraries further create serious discoverability challenges for newer open-source projects. These results highlight the need to improve LLMs' adaptability to diverse programming contexts and to develop mechanisms for mitigating programming language and library bias.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.</p></details> |  |

Automating the generation of privacy computing code with Large Language Models can streamline development effort and lower the barrier to using privacy computing frameworks. However, existing LLMs still encounter challenges in code translation for privacy-preserving computation, such as translating Python to MP-SPDZ, due to the scarcity of MP-SPDZ data required for effective pre-training or fine-tuning. Moreover, the lack of a benchmark further complicates the evaluation of translation quality. To address the limitations, this work proposes SPDZCoder, a rule-based framework that combines LLMs with expert knowledge for generating privacy-computing code without requiring additional training data. Specifically, SPDZCoder employ a rigorous procedure for collecting high-quality expert knowledge to represent the semantic-expressing differences between Python and MP-SPDZ, and to derive transformation rules for translating Python to MP-SPDZ based on these knowledge. Then, SPDZCoder progressively converts Python code into MP-SPDZ code using transformation rules in a three stage pipeline. To evaluate SPDZCoder, we manually constructed a benchmark dataset, SPDZEval, which comprises six data splits, each representing a distinct class of challenging tasks in MP-SPDZ implementation. Extensive experiments show that SPDZCoder achieves superior performance, significantly surpassing baselines in pass@1 and pass@2. Specifically, SPDZCoder attains an overall correctness of 85.94% and 92.01% in pass@1 and pass@2, respectively, whereas the best-performing baseline achieves 63.58% and 76.36%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on temporal questions and historical knowledge is limited because they often cannot understand temporal scope and orientation or neglect the temporal aspect altogether. In this study, we aim to measure precisely how robust LLMs are for question answering based on their ability to process temporal information and perform tasks requiring temporal reasoning and temporal factual knowledge. Specifically, we design eight time-sensitive robustness tests for factual information to check the sensitivity of six popular LLMs in the zero-shot setting. Overall, we find LLMs lacking temporal robustness, especially to temporal reformulations and the use of different granularities of temporal references. We show how a selection of these eight tests can be used automatically to judge a model's temporal robustness for user questions on the fly. Finally, we apply the findings of this study to improve the temporal QA performance by up to 55 percent.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Despite their widespread adoption, SRS often grapple with the long-tail user dilemma, resulting in less effective recommendations for individuals with limited interaction records. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their profound capability to discern semantic relationships among items, has opened new avenues for enhancing SRS through data augmentation. Nonetheless, current methodologies encounter obstacles, including the absence of collaborative signals and the prevalence of hallucination phenomena. In this work, we present LLMSeR, an innovative framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-prior items, thereby improving the efficacy of Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). To alleviate the challenge of insufficient collaborative signals, we introduce the Semantic Interaction Augmentor (SIA), a method that integrates both semantic and collaborative information to comprehensively augment user interaction data. Moreover, to weaken the adverse effects of hallucination in SRS, we develop the Adaptive Reliability Validation (ARV), a validation technique designed to assess the reliability of the generated pseudo items. Complementing these advancements, we also devise a Dual-Channel Training strategy, ensuring seamless integration of data augmentation into the SRS training process.Extensive experiments conducted with three widely-used SRS models demonstrate the generalizability and efficacy of LLMSeR.</p></details> |  |

Through our new dataset BASSE (BAsque and Spanish Summarization Evaluation), we address this situation by collecting human judgments on 2,040 abstractive summaries in Basque and Spanish, generated either manually or by five LLMs with four different prompts. For each summary, annotators evaluated five criteria on a 5-point Likert scale: coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance, and 5W1H. We use these data to reevaluate traditional automatic metrics used for evaluating summaries, as well as several LLM-as-a-Judge models that show strong performance on this task in English. Our results show that currently proprietary judge LLMs have the highest correlation with human judgments, followed by criteria-specific automatic metrics, while open-sourced judge LLMs perform poorly. We release BASSE and our code publicly, along with the first large-scale Basque summarization dataset containing 22,525 news articles with their subheads.</p></details> |  |

We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B Instruct on synthetically generated Modelica code for different reactor scenarios. We compare the performance of our fine-tuned model to the baseline Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model and GPT4o. We manually assess the models' predictions regarding the syntactic and semantic accuracy of the generated dynamic models. We find that considerable improvements are achieved by the fine-tuned model with respect to both the semantic and the syntactic accuracy of the Modelica models. However, the fine-tuned model lacks a satisfactory ability to generalize to unseen scenarios compared to GPT4o.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a gap in research regarding the effectiveness of LLMs in non-English mental health support applications. To address this problem, we present a novel multilingual adaptation of widely-used mental health datasets, translated from English into six languages (e.g., Greek, Turkish, French, Portuguese, German, and Finnish). This dataset enables a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in detecting mental health conditions and assessing their severity across multiple languages. By experimenting with GPT and Llama, we observe considerable variability in performance across languages, despite being evaluated on the same translated dataset. This inconsistency underscores the complexities inherent in multilingual mental health support, where language-specific nuances and mental health data coverage can affect the accuracy of the models. Through comprehensive error analysis, we emphasize the risks of relying exclusively on LLMs in medical settings (e.g., their potential to contribute to misdiagnoses). Moreover, our proposed approach offers significant cost savings for multilingual tasks, presenting a major advantage for broad-scale implementation.</p></details> |  |

Lay People can Distinguish Large Language Models from Lawyers, but still Favour Advice from an LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07871v2)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.07871v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are seemingly infiltrating every domain, and the legal context is no exception. In this paper, we present the results of three experiments (total N = 288) that investigated lay people's willingness to act upon, and their ability to discriminate between, LLM- and lawyer-generated legal advice. In Experiment 1, participants judged their willingness to act on legal advice when the source of the advice was either known or unknown. When the advice source was unknown, participants indicated that they were significantly more willing to act on the LLM-generated advice. The result of the source unknown condition was replicated in Experiment 2. Intriguingly, despite participants indicating higher willingness to act on LLM-generated advice in Experiments 1 and 2, participants discriminated between the LLM- and lawyer-generated texts significantly above chance-level in Experiment 3. Lastly, we discuss potential explanations and risks of our findings, limitations and future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACMCo...</summary><p>ACMConference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'25)</p></details> |

However, CPUs are emerging as a flexible and lower-cost alternative, especially when targeting inference and reasoning workloads. RISC-V is rapidly gaining traction in this area, given its open and vendor-neutral ISA. However, the RISC-V hardware for LLM workloads and the corresponding software ecosystem are not fully mature and streamlined, given the requirement of domain-specific tuning. This paper aims at filling this gap, focusing on optimizing LLM inference on the Sophon SG2042, the first commercially available many-core RISC-V CPU with vector processing capabilities. On two recent state-of-the-art LLMs optimized for reasoning, DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 8B and DeepSeek R1 Distill QWEN 14B, we achieve 4.32/2.29 token/s for token generation and 6.54/3.68 token/s for prompt processing, with a speed up of up 2.9x/3.0x compared to our baseline.</p></details> |  |

We fine-tune LLMs to produce both JSON action calls and text responses. Our experiments show that 16-bit and 8-bit quantized variants preserve high accuracy on slot and intent detection and maintain strong semantic coherence in generated text, while the 4-bit model, while retaining generative fluency, suffers a noticeable drop in device-service classification accuracy. Further evaluations on noisy human (non-synthetic) prompts and out-of-domain intents confirm the models' generalization ability, obtaining around 80--86\% accuracy. While the average inference time is 5--6 seconds per query -- acceptable for one-shot commands but suboptimal for multi-turn dialogue -- our results affirm that an on-device LLM can effectively unify command interpretation and flexible response generation for home automation without relying on specialized hardware.</p></details> | WNUT 2025 |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPO (TEMporal Preference Optimization), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and ``Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPO as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the concept of a visual region in the human brain, we investigate the existence of an analogous \textit{visual region} within LLMs that functions as a cognitive core, and explore the potential of efficient training of LVLMs via selective layers tuning. Using Bunny-Llama-3-8B-V for detailed analysis and other three LVLMs for validation across diverse visual and textual tasks, we find that selectively updating 25\% of LLMs layers, when sparsely and uniformly distributed, can preserve nearly 99\% of visual performance and maintain or improve textual task results, while effectively reducing training time. Based on this targeted training approach, we further propose a novel visual region-based pruning paradigm, removing non-critical layers outside the visual region, which can achieve minimal performance loss. This study offers an effective and efficient strategy for LVLM training and inference by activating a layer-wise visual region within LLMs, which proves consistently effective across different models.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating manuscript critiques, their ability to synthesize high-stakes meta-reviews, which require conflict-aware reasoning and consensus derivation, remains underdeveloped. Existing methods fail to effectively handle conflicting viewpoints within differing opinions, and often introduce additional cognitive biases, such as anchoring effects and conformity bias.To overcome these limitations, we propose the Cognitive Alignment Framework (CAF), a dual-process architecture that transforms LLMs into adaptive scientific arbitrators. By operationalizing Kahneman's dual-process theory, CAF introduces a three-step cognitive pipeline: review initialization, incremental integration, and cognitive alignment.Empirical validation shows that CAF outperforms existing LLM-based methods, with sentiment consistency gains reaching up to 19.47\% and content consistency improving by as much as 12.95\%.</p></details> | 23 pages |

However, these models face significant challenges in producing version-aware code for rapidly evolving languages like Rust, where frequent Application Programming Interfaces (API) changes across versions lead to compatibility issues and correctness errors. Existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of how models navigate API transitions, relying on labor-intensive manual curation and offering limited version-specific insights. To address this gap, we present RustEvo, a novel framework for constructing dynamic benchmarks that evaluate the ability of LLMs to adapt to evolving Rust APIs. RustEvo automates dataset creation by synthesizing 588 API changes (380 from Rust standard libraries, 208 from 15 third-party crates) into programming tasks mirroring real-world challenges. These tasks cover four API evolution categories: Stabilizations, Signature Changes, Behavioral Changes, and Deprecations, reflecting their actual distribution in the Rust ecosystem. Experiments on state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal significant performance variations: models achieve a 65.8% average success rate on stabilized APIs but only 38.0% on behavioral changes, highlighting difficulties in detecting semantic shifts without signature alterations. Knowledge cutoff dates strongly influence performance, with models scoring 56.1% on before-cutoff APIs versus 32.5% on after-cutoff tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this gap, improving success rates by 13.5% on average for APIs released after model training. Our findings underscore the necessity of our evolution-aware benchmarks to advance the adaptability of LLMs in fast-paced software ecosystems. The framework and the benchmarks are publicly released at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/RustEvo.</p></details> |  |

However, when this support received does not align with their specific needs, it may prove ineffective or even detrimental. This necessitates a model capable of identifying the social support needs in questions. However, training such a model is challenging due to the scarcity and class imbalance issues of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we follow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel framework, Hybrid Approach for SOcial Support need classification (HA-SOS). HA-SOS integrates an answer-enhanced semi-supervised learning approach, a text data augmentation technique leveraging large language models (LLMs) with reliability- and diversity-aware sample selection mechanism, and a unified training process to automatically label social support needs in questions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that HA-SOS significantly outperforms existing question classification models and alternative semi-supervised learning approaches. This research contributes to the literature on social support, question classification, semi-supervised learning, and text data augmentation. In practice, our HA-SOS framework facilitates online Q&A platform managers and answerers to better understand users' social support needs, enabling them to provide timely, personalized answers and interventions.</p></details> | 55 pages |

While a lot of works have focused on the efficiency of single-LLM application (e.g., offloading, request scheduling, parallelism strategy selection), multi-LLM applications receive less attention, particularly in offline inference scenarios. In this work, we aim to improve the offline end-to-end inference efficiency of multi-LLM applications in the single-node multi-GPU environment. The problem involves two key decisions: (1) determining which LLMs to run concurrently each time (we may not run all the models at the same time), and (2) selecting a parallelism strategy to use for each LLM. This problem is NP-hard. Naive solutions may not work well because the running time for a model to complete a set of requests depends on the request workload and the selected parallelism strategy, and they lack an accurate model of the running time. As the LLM output lengths are unknown before running, to estimate the model running time, we propose a sampling-then-simulation method which first estimates the output lengths by sampling from an empirical cumulative function we obtained from a large dataset in advance, and then simulates the LLM inference process accordingly. Based on the simulation, we estimate the per-iteration latencys to get the total latency. A greedy method is proposed to optimize the scheduling of the LLMs in the application across the GPUs. We then propose a framework SamuLLM which contains two phases: planning, which calls the greedy method for an application and running, which runs the application and dynamically adjust the model scheduling based on the runtime information. Experiments on 3 applications and a mixed application show that SamuLLM can achieve 1.0-2.4$\times$ end-to-end speedups compared to the competitors.</p></details> |  |

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Furthermore, we propose a smooth learning strategy that allows for seamless adaptation to new restoration tasks while maintaining performance on existing ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cat-AIR achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of restoration tasks, requiring fewer FLOPs than previous methods, establishing new benchmarks for efficient all-in-one image restoration.</p></details> |  |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

In this paper, we propose Fractal-IR, a fractal-based design that progressively refines degraded images by repeatedly expanding local information into broader regions. This fractal architecture naturally captures local details at early stages and seamlessly transitions toward global context in deeper fractal stages, removing the need for computationally heavy long-range self-attention mechanisms. Moveover, we observe the challenge in scaling up vision transformers for IR tasks. Through a series of analyses, we identify a holistic set of strategies to effectively guide model scaling. Extensive experimental results show that Fractal-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, denoising, JPEG artifact removal, IR in adverse weather conditions, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and demosaicking. For $2\times$ SR on Manga109, Fractal-IR achieves a 0.21 dB PSNR gain. For grayscale image denoising on Urban100, Fractal-IR surpasses the previous method by 0.2 dB for $\sigma=50$.</p></details> |  |

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing.

The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) offers a promising alternative by initializing the generative process from corrupted images while leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB restructures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image at each generative step, effectively preserving and utilizing its information. To enable direct use of pretrained I$^2$SB models without additional training, we ensure consistency in marginal distributions. Extensive experiments across many image corruptions, including noise, low resolution, JPEG compression, and sparse sampling, and multiple image modalities, such as natural, human face, and medical images, demonstrate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB. Compared to I$^2$SB, I$^3$SB achieves the same perceptual quality with fewer generative steps, while maintaining or improving fidelity to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, accepted by Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, most existing methods address only a single type of degradation (e.g., blur, noise, or haze) at a time, limiting their real-world applicability where multiple degradations often occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose UniCoRN, a unified image restoration approach capable of handling multiple degradation types simultaneously using a multi-head diffusion model. Specifically, we uncover the potential of low-level visual cues extracted from images in guiding a controllable diffusion model for real-world image restoration and we design a multi-head control network adaptable via a mixture-of-experts strategy. We train our model without any prior assumption of specific degradations, through a smartly designed curriculum learning recipe. Additionally, we also introduce MetaRestore, a metalens imaging benchmark containing images with multiple degradations and artifacts. Extensive evaluations on several challenging datasets, including our benchmark, demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains and can robustly restore images with severe degradations.

In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.</p></details> |  |

Existing Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) offer stable restoration performance but require manual selection of degradation matrices for each degradation type, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this issue, we propose the Vision-Language-guided Unfolding Network (VLU-Net), a unified DUN framework for handling multiple degradation types simultaneously. VLU-Net leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) refined on degraded image-text pairs to align image features with degradation descriptions, selecting the appropriate transform for target degradation. By integrating an automatic VLM-based gradient estimation strategy into the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, VLU-Net effectively tackles complex multi-degradation restoration tasks while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical feature unfolding structure to enhance VLU-Net framework, efficiently synthesizing degradation patterns across various levels. VLU-Net is the first all-in-one DUN framework and outperforms current leading one-by-one and all-in-one end-to-end methods by 3.74 dB on the SOTS dehazing dataset and 1.70 dB on the Rain100L deraining dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |

However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We design a numerical method based on the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm for the Wasserstain distance and the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for the total variation, and the convergence analysis of the proposed numerical method is established. We also consider replacing the total variation in our model by one of its modifications developed in \cite{zhu}, with the aim of suppressing the stair-casing effect and preserving image contrasts.

In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

Specifically, PPTformer contains two parts: an Image Restoration Network (IRNet) for restoring images from degraded observations and a Parser-Prompted Feature Generation Network (PPFGNet) for providing IRNet with reliable parser information to boost restoration. To enhance the integration of the parser within IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter Parser-Prompted Attention (InterPPA) to implicitly and explicitly learn useful parser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross attention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception of the parser from a long-range and intra-layer perspective. Conversely, the InterPPA initially fuses restoration features with those of the parser, followed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to explicitly perceive parser information. Further, we propose a parser-prompted feed-forward network to guide restoration within pixel-wise gating modulation. Experimental results show that PPTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image deraining, defocus deblurring, desnowing, and low-light enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is accepted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing methods across various metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

To cope with these challenges, we analyze the restoration process in depth through a progressive spectral perspective, and deconstruct the complex UHD restoration problem into three progressive stages: zero-frequency enhancement, low-frequency restoration, and high-frequency refinement. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, ERR, which comprises three collaborative sub-networks: the zero-frequency enhancer (ZFE), the low-frequency restorer (LFR), and the high-frequency refiner (HFR). Specifically, the ZFE integrates global priors to learn global mapping, while the LFR restores low-frequency information, emphasizing reconstruction of coarse-grained content. Finally, the HFR employs our designed frequency-windowed kolmogorov-arnold networks (FW-KAN) to refine textures and details, producing high-quality image restoration. Our approach significantly outperforms previous UHD methods across various tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we introduce ABAIR, a simple yet effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration model that not only handles multiple degradations and generalizes well to unseen distortions but also efficiently integrates new degradations by training only a small subset of parameters. We first train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations. To enhance its ability to recognize distortions, we incorporate a segmentation head that estimates per-pixel degradation types. Second, we adapt our initial model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. This specialize-then-merge approach is both powerful in addressing specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks. Moreover, our model not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance on five- and three-task IR setups but also demonstrates superior generalization to unseen degradations and composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system.

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional scanners achieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then merging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue defocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to restore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes. However, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate defocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic complexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution cascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in preserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly propose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial prompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that describe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the fine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by feeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology images from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture of prompts to clinical usage.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance.

This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mrluin/UniRestorer.</p></details> | 30 pages, 20 figures |

Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches struggle with addressing complex and ambiguously defined degradation types. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic degradation decomposition network for all-in-one image restoration, named D$^3$Net. D$^3$Net achieves degradation-adaptive image restoration with guided prompt through cross-domain interaction and dynamic degradation decomposition. Concretely, in D$^3$Net, the proposed Cross-Domain Degradation Analyzer (CDDA) engages in deep interaction between frequency domain degradation characteristics and spatial domain image features to identify and model variations of different degradation types on the image manifold, generating degradation correction prompt and strategy prompt, which guide the following decomposition process. Furthermore, the prompt-based Dynamic Decomposition Mechanism (DDM) for progressive degradation decomposition, that encourages the network to adaptively select restoration strategies utilizing the two-level prompt generated by CDDA. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation between CDDA and DDM, D$^3$Net achieves superior flexibility and scalability in handling unknown degradation, while effectively reducing unnecessary computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks demonstrate that D$^3$Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially improving PSNR by 5.47dB and 3.30dB on the SOTS-Outdoor and GoPro datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation reveals a critical gap: existing approaches consistently fail on severely degraded videos--precisely where diffusion models' generative capabilities are most needed. We identify that existing diffusion-based VSR methods struggle primarily because they face an overwhelming learning burden: simultaneously modeling complex degradation distributions, content representations, and temporal relationships with limited high-quality training data. To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos. Our work reveals that addressing the learning strategy, rather than focusing solely on architectural complexity, is the critical path toward robust real-world video super-resolution with diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xh9998.github.io/DiffVSR-project/</p></details> |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, this enhanced contrast comes at the cost of system complexity, constrained by an inherent trade-off between spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we present a deep learning-based approach that restores and enhances pixel resolution post-acquisition without any a priori knowledge. Fine-tuned using metrics aligned with the imaging model, our physics-aware method achieves a 16X pixel super-resolution enhancement and a 12X imaging speedup without the need of additional training data for transfer learning. Applied to both synthetic and experimental data from five different sample types, we demonstrate that the model preserves biological integrity, ensuring no features are lost or hallucinated. We also concretely demonstrate the model's ability to reveal disease-associated metabolic changes in Downs syndrome that would otherwise remain undetectable. Furthermore, we provide physical insights into the inner workings of the model, paving the way for future refinements that could potentially surpass instrumental limits in an explainable manner. All methods are available as open-source software on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Most existing deweathering methods rely on increasing the network scale and data volume to achieve better performance which requires more expensive computing power. Also, many methods lack generalization for specific applications. In the traffic surveillance screener, the main challenges are snow removal and veil effect elimination. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods. Our approach also demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy when applied to real traffic surveillance images.</p></details> |  |

More recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach, which utilizes a pre-trained \textit{generative diffusion model}, has gained great popularity for solving IR problems through stochastic sampling. The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity. The unsatisfactory results are due to the lack of integration of these strategies in the IR tasks. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot IR scheme, dubbed Reconciling Diffusion Model in Dual (RDMD), which leverages only a \textbf{single} pre-trained diffusion model to construct \textbf{two} complementary regularizers. Specifically, the diffusion model in RDMD will iteratively perform deterministic denoising and stochastic sampling, aiming to achieve high-fidelity image restoration with appealing perceptual quality. RDMD also allows users to customize the distortion-perception tradeoff with a single hyperparameter, enhancing the adaptability of the restoration process in different practical scenarios. Extensive experiments on several IR tasks demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve superior results compared to existing approaches on both the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a relatively lightweight Adapter that leverages the powerful generative capabilities of pretrained priors to achieve photo-realistic image restoration. The Adapters can be adapt to both denoising UNet and DiT, and performs excellent.</p></details> |  |

Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most convolutional neural network-based methods typically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale information. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often insufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement them. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides in feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or consider the relationship between global and local features. This paper proposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed network explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within feature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural features and global representation information of the image. Since the network struggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation, the structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and supplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in the feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element representation information. The graph within the network learns real-time dynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is propagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local element block information and global element representation information from the feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information in the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Toward this end, we present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal that operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike existing methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent watermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals broader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden messages. MorphoMod offers a robust, adaptable solution for watermark removal and opens avenues for further advancements in image restoration and adversarial manipulation.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction.

However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels.

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction.

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |

Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information.

However, their high computational complexity-manifested in elevated FLOPs and parameter counts-limits their application in real-world scenarios.

To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models.

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images.

Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

The target is defined by a segmentation mask and the desired action is described via a text prompt. Unlike existing controllable image-to-video diffusion models that often rely on dense structural or motion cues to guide the actor's movements toward the target, our target-aware model requires only a simple mask to indicate the target, leveraging the generalization capabilities of pretrained models to produce plausible actions. This makes our method particularly effective for human-object interaction (HOI) scenarios, where providing precise action guidance is challenging, and further enables the use of video diffusion models for high-level action planning in applications such as robotics. We build our target-aware model by extending a baseline model to incorporate the target mask as an additional input. To enforce target awareness, we introduce a special token that encodes the target's spatial information within the text prompt. We then fine-tune the model with our curated dataset using a novel cross-attention loss that aligns the cross-attention maps associated with this token with the input target mask. To further improve performance, we selectively apply this loss to the most semantically relevant transformer blocks and attention regions. Experimental results show that our target-aware model outperforms existing solutions in generating videos where actors interact accurately with the specified targets. We further demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream applications: video content creation and zero-shot 3D HOI motion synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at https://taeksuu.github.io/tavid/</p></details> |

This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.

To address this limitation, we propose a multi-modal framework for Synchronous Video Prediction (SyncVP) that incorporates complementary data modalities, enhancing the richness and accuracy of future predictions. SyncVP builds on pre-trained modality-specific diffusion models and introduces an efficient spatio-temporal cross-attention module to enable effective information sharing across modalities. We evaluate SyncVP on standard benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes and BAIR, using depth as an additional modality. We furthermore demonstrate its generalization to other modalities on SYNTHIA with semantic information and ERA5-Land with climate data. Notably, SyncVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in scenarios where only one modality is present, demonstrating its robustness and potential for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |

Artificial intelligence has the potential to enhance this process. However, the limited availability of embryo data presents challenges for training deep learning models. To address this, we trained two generative models using two datasets-one we created and made publicly available, and one existing public dataset-to generate synthetic embryo images at various cell stages, including 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst. These were combined with real images to train classification models for embryo cell stage prediction. Our results demonstrate that incorporating synthetic images alongside real data improved classification performance, with the model achieving 97% accuracy compared to 94.5% when trained solely on real data. This trend remained consistent when tested on an external Blastocyst dataset from a different clinic. Notably, even when trained exclusively on synthetic data and tested on real data, the model achieved a high accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, combining synthetic data from both generative models yielded better classification results than using data from a single generative model. Four embryologists evaluated the fidelity of the synthetic images through a Turing test, during which they annotated inaccuracies and offered feedback. The analysis showed the diffusion model outperformed the generative adversarial network, deceiving embryologists 66.6% versus 25.3% and achieving lower Frechet inception distance scores.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly diffusion models, have improved accelerated MRI reconstruction. However, existing diffusion models' training often relies on fully sampled data, models incur high computational costs, and often lack uncertainty estimation, limiting their clinical applicability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Dual-domain Multi-path Self-supervised Diffusion Model (DMSM), that integrates a self-supervised dual-domain diffusion model training scheme, a lightweight hybrid attention network for the reconstruction diffusion model, and a multi-path inference strategy, to enhance reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. Unlike traditional diffusion-based models, DMSM eliminates the dependency on training from fully sampled data, making it more practical for real-world clinical settings. We evaluated DMSM on two human MRI datasets, demonstrating that it achieves favorable performance over several supervised and self-supervised baselines, particularly in preserving fine anatomical structures and suppressing artifacts under high acceleration factors. Additionally, our model generates uncertainty maps that correlate reasonably well with reconstruction errors, offering valuable clinically interpretable guidance and potentially enhancing diagnostic confidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing omnimatte methods assume a static background or accurate pose and depth estimation and produce poor decompositions when these assumptions are violated. Furthermore, due to the lack of generative prior on natural videos, existing methods cannot complete dynamic occluded regions. We present a novel generative layered video decomposition framework to address the omnimatte problem. Our method does not assume a stationary scene or require camera pose or depth information and produces clean, complete layers, including convincing completions of occluded dynamic regions. Our core idea is to train a video diffusion model to identify and remove scene effects caused by a specific object. We show that this model can be finetuned from an existing video inpainting model with a small, carefully curated dataset, and demonstrate high-quality decompositions and editing results for a wide range of casually captured videos containing soft shadows, glossy reflections, splashing water, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Over the long term, accurately quantifying the power generation of renewable energy under the influence of climate change is essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However, due to interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often lacks the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty. The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation on future long-term scales. Case studies were conducted in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under two climate pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM outperforms existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate data. Furthermore, the research highlights the estimation biases introduced when low-resolution climate data is used for power conversion.</p></details> |  |

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

At inference time, however, these models are generally unable to provide predictions over long time rollouts due to accumulation of errors leading to diverging trajectories. In essence, emulators operate out of distribution, and controlling the online distribution quickly becomes intractable in large-scale settings. To address this fundamental issue, and focusing on time-stationary systems admitting an invariant measure, we leverage diffusion models to obtain an implicit estimator of the score of this invariant measure. We show that this model of the score function can be used to stabilize autoregressive emulator rollouts by applying on-the-fly denoising during inference, a process we call \textit{thermalization}. Thermalizing an emulator rollout is shown to extend the time horizon of stable predictions by an order of magnitude in complex systems exhibiting turbulent and chaotic behavior, opening up a novel application of diffusion models in the context of neural emulation.</p></details> |  |

Despite human hand synthesis already being an intricate problem, generating objects in contact with hands and their interactions presents an even more challenging task, especially when the objects exhibit obvious variations in size and shape. To cope with these issues, we present a novel video Reenactment framework focusing on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) via an adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion model (Re-HOLD). Our key insight is to employ specialized layout representation for hands and objects, respectively. Such representations enable effective disentanglement of hand modeling and object adaptation to diverse motion sequences. To further improve the generation quality of HOI, we have designed an interactive textural enhancement module for both hands and objects by introducing two independent memory banks. We also propose a layout-adjusting strategy for the cross-object reenactment scenario to adaptively adjust unreasonable layouts caused by diverse object sizes during inference. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.

We propose the first motion unlearning benchmark by filtering toxic motions from the large and recent text-to-motion datasets of HumanML3D and Motion-X. We propose baselines, by adapting state-of-the-art image unlearning techniques to process spatio-temporal signals. Finally, we propose a novel motion unlearning model based on Latent Code Replacement, which we dub LCR.

Recently, the diffusion model, which demonstrates unprecedented generative potential, has been explored in image fusion. However, these approaches typically incorporate predefined multimodal guidance into diffusion, failing to capture the dynamically changing significance of each modality, while lacking theoretical guarantees. To address this issue, we reveal a significant spatio-temporal imbalance in image denoising; specifically, the diffusion model produces dynamic information gains in different image regions with denoising steps. Based on this observation, we Dig into the Diffusion Information Gains (Dig2DIG) and theoretically derive a diffusion-based dynamic image fusion framework that provably reduces the upper bound of the generalization error. Accordingly, we introduce diffusion information gains (DIG) to quantify the information contribution of each modality at different denoising steps, thereby providing dynamic guidance during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on multiple fusion scenarios confirm that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches in terms of both fusion quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, they sometimes struggle to accurately depict specific entities described in prompts, a limitation known as the entity missing problem in compositional generation. While prior studies suggested that adjusting cross-attention maps during the denoising process could alleviate this problem, they did not systematically investigate which objective functions could best address it. This study examines three potential causes of the entity-missing problem, focusing on cross-attention dynamics: (1) insufficient attention intensity for certain entities, (2) overly broad attention spread, and (3) excessive overlap between attention maps of different entities. We found that reducing overlap in attention maps between entities can effectively minimize the rate of entity missing. Specifically, we hypothesize that tokens related to specific entities compete for attention on certain image regions during the denoising process, which can lead to divided attention across tokens and prevent accurate representation of each entity. To address this issue, we introduced four loss functions, Intersection over Union (IoU), center-of-mass (CoM) distance, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and clustering compactness (CC) to regulate attention overlap during denoising steps without the need for retraining. Experimental results across a wide variety of benchmarks reveal that these proposed training-free methods significantly improve compositional accuracy, outperforming previous approaches in visual question answering (VQA), captioning scores, CLIP similarity, and human evaluations. Notably, these methods improved human evaluation scores by 9% over the best baseline, demonstrating substantial improvements in compositional alignment.</p></details> | TMLR - 2025 |

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

Although state-of-the-art generative video models have advanced significantly for natural videos, they remain underexplored in microscopy domains. To address this gap, we fine-tune a pretrained video diffusion model on microscopy-specific sequences, exploring three conditioning strategies: (1) text prompts derived from numeric phenotypic measurements (e.g., proliferation rates, migration speeds, cell-death frequencies), (2) direct numeric embeddings of phenotype scores, and (3) image-conditioned generation, where an initial microscopy frame is extended into a complete video sequence. Evaluation using biologically meaningful morphological, proliferation, and migration metrics demonstrates that fine-tuning substantially improves realism and accurately captures critical cellular behaviors such as mitosis and migration. Notably, the fine-tuned model also generalizes beyond the training horizon, generating coherent cell dynamics even in extended sequences. However, precisely controlling specific phenotypic characteristics remains challenging, highlighting opportunities for future work to enhance conditioning methods. Our results demonstrate the potential for domain-specific fine-tuning of generative video models to produce biologically plausible synthetic microscopy data, supporting applications such as in-silico hypothesis testing and data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

These motion cues are typically derived from video data but are susceptible to limitations including low temporal resolution, motion blur, overexposure, and inaccuracies under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras provide data streams with exceptionally high temporal resolution, a wide dynamic range, and inherent resistance to motion blur and exposure issues. In this work, we propose EvAnimate, a framework that leverages event streams as motion cues to animate static human images. Our approach employs a specialized event representation that transforms asynchronous event streams into 3-channel slices with controllable slicing rates and appropriate slice density, ensuring compatibility with diffusion models. Subsequently, a dual-branch architecture generates high-quality videos by harnessing the inherent motion dynamics of the event streams, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal consistency. Specialized data augmentation strategies further enhance cross-person generalization. Finally, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and extreme scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</p></details> |  |

We propose and evaluate two autoencoder architectures: a homogeneous model forcing amino acids of the same type to be identically distributed in the latent space, and an inhomogeneous model employing a noise-based variant of masking. As a baseline we take a latent space learned by masked language modelling, and evaluate discriminative capability on a range of protein property prediction tasks. Our finding is twofold: the diffusion models trained on both our proposed variants display higher discriminative power than the one trained on the masked language model baseline, none of the diffusion representations achieve the performance of the masked language model embeddings themselves.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel methodology, AIM2PC , which utilizes our generated dataset that includes complete 3D point clouds and determined camera poses. Our approach takes features from a single aerial image as input and concatenates them with essential additional conditions, such as binary masks and Sobel edge maps, to enable more edge-aware reconstruction.

Building upon a lengthy Markov chain, diffusion-based methods possess remarkable modeling capacity, enabling them to achieve outstanding performance in real-world scenarios. Unlike previous methods that focus on modifying the noise schedule or sampling process to enhance performance, our approach emphasizes the improved utilization of LR information. We find that different regions of the LR image can be viewed as corresponding to different timesteps in a diffusion process, where flat areas are closer to the target HR distribution but edge and texture regions are farther away. In these flat areas, applying a slight noise is more advantageous for the reconstruction. We associate this characteristic with uncertainty and propose to apply uncertainty estimate to guide region-specific noise level control, a technique we refer to as Uncertainty-guided Noise Weighting. Pixels with lower uncertainty (i.e., flat regions) receive reduced noise to preserve more LR information, therefore improving performance. Furthermore, we modify the network architecture of previous methods to develop our Uncertainty-guided Perturbation Super-Resolution (UPSR) model.

This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://atfortes.github.io/projects/bokeh-diffusion/</p></details> |
| **[Hiding Images in Diffusion Models by Editing Learned Score Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18459v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18459v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hiding data using neural networks (i.e., neural steganography) has achieved remarkable success across both discriminative classifiers and generative adversarial networks. However, the potential of data hiding in diffusion models remains relatively unexplored. Current methods exhibit limitations in achieving high extraction accuracy, model fidelity, and hiding efficiency due primarily to the entanglement of the hiding and extraction processes with multiple denoising diffusion steps. To address these, we describe a simple yet effective approach that embeds images at specific timesteps in the reverse diffusion process by editing the learned score functions. Additionally, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines gradient-based parameter selection with low-rank adaptation to enhance model fidelity and hiding efficiency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method extracts high-quality images at human-indistinguishable levels, replicates the original model behaviors at both sample and population levels, and embeds images orders of magnitude faster than prior methods. Besides, our method naturally supports multi-recipient scenarios through independent extraction channels.</p></details> |  |

However, exploration of aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences remains limited. In comparison to supervised fine-tuning, existing methods that align diffusion model suffer from low training efficiency and subpar generation quality due to the long Markov chain process and the intractability of the reverse process. To address these limitations, we introduce DDIM-InPO, an efficient method for direct preference alignment of diffusion models. Our approach conceptualizes diffusion model as a single-step generative model, allowing us to fine-tune the outputs of specific latent variables selectively. In order to accomplish this objective, we first assign implicit rewards to any latent variable directly via a reparameterization technique. Then we construct an Inversion technique to estimate appropriate latent variables for preference optimization. This modification process enables the diffusion model to only fine-tune the outputs of latent variables that have a strong correlation with the preference dataset. Experimental results indicate that our DDIM-InPO achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 400 steps of fine-tuning, surpassing all preference aligning baselines for T2I diffusion models in human preference evaluation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions, often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However, they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation, which degrades output quality. On the other hand, upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics, while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness.

Existing methods mostly assess the generated panoramas with InceptionNet or CLIP based metrics, which tend to perceive the image quality and is \textbf{not suitable for evaluating the distortion}. In this work, we first propose a distortion-specific CLIP, named Distort-CLIP to accurately evaluate the panorama distortion and discover the \textbf{``visual cheating''} phenomenon in previous works (\ie, tending to improve the visual results by sacrificing distortion accuracy). This phenomenon arises because prior methods employ a single network to learn the distinct panorama distortion and content completion at once, which leads the model to prioritize optimizing the latter. To address the phenomenon, we propose \textbf{PanoDecouple}, a decoupled diffusion model framework, which decouples the panorama generation into distortion guidance and content completion, aiming to generate panoramas with both accurate distortion and visual appeal. Specifically, we design a DistortNet for distortion guidance by imposing panorama-specific distortion prior and a modified condition registration mechanism; and a ContentNet for content completion by imposing perspective image information. Additionally, a distortion correction loss function with Distort-CLIP is introduced to constrain the distortion explicitly. The extensive experiments validate that PanoDecouple surpasses existing methods both in distortion and visual metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025.

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs.

Previous work has typically relied on text-toimage (T2I) generative models to produce pairs of original and edited images that simulate the input/output of an instruction-guided image-editing model. However, these image pairs often fail to align with the specified edit instructions due to the limitations of T2I models, which negatively impacts models trained on such datasets. To address this, we present Instruct-CLIP, a self-supervised method that learns the semantic changes between original and edited images to refine and better align the instructions in existing datasets. Furthermore, we adapt Instruct-CLIP to handle noisy latent images and diffusion timesteps so that it can be used to train latent diffusion models (LDMs) [19] and efficiently enforce alignment between the edit instruction and the image changes in latent space at any step of the diffusion pipeline. We use Instruct-CLIP to correct the InstructPix2Pix dataset and get over 120K refined samples we then use to fine-tune their model, guided by our novel Instruct-CLIP-based loss function. The resulting model can produce edits that are more aligned with the given instructions.

However, this approach is fundamentally flawed: the uniform operation of the forward process across all pixels compromises normal pixels while attempting to combat adversarial perturbations, resulting in the target model producing incorrect predictions. Simply relying on low-intensity noise is insufficient for effective defense. To address this critical issue, we implement a heterogeneous purification strategy grounded in the interpretability of neural networks. Our method decisively applies higher-intensity noise to specific pixels that the target model focuses on while the remaining pixels are subjected to only low-intensity noise. This requirement motivates us to redesign the sampling process of the diffusion model, allowing for the effective removal of varying noise levels. Furthermore, to evaluate our method against strong adaptative attack, our proposed method sharply reduces time cost and memory usage through a single-step resampling. The empirical evidence from extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms most current adversarial training and purification techniques by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDDM: Pseudo Depth Diffusion Model for RGB-PD Semantic Segmentation Based in Complex Indoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18393v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18393v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of RGB and depth modalities significantly enhances the accuracy of segmenting complex indoor scenes, with depth data from RGB-D cameras playing a crucial role in this improvement. However, collecting an RGB-D dataset is more expensive than an RGB dataset due to the need for specialized depth sensors. Aligning depth and RGB images also poses challenges due to sensor positioning and issues like missing data and noise. In contrast, Pseudo Depth (PD) from high-precision depth estimation algorithms can eliminate the dependence on RGB-D sensors and alignment processes, as well as provide effective depth information and show significant potential in semantic segmentation. Therefore, to explore the practicality of utilizing pseudo depth instead of real depth for semantic segmentation, we design an RGB-PD segmentation pipeline to integrate RGB and pseudo depth and propose a Pseudo Depth Aggregation Module (PDAM) for fully exploiting the informative clues provided by the diverse pseudo depth maps. The PDAM aggregates multiple pseudo depth maps into a single modality, making it easily adaptable to other RGB-D segmentation methods. In addition, the pre-trained diffusion model serves as a strong feature extractor for RGB segmentation tasks, but multi-modal diffusion-based segmentation methods remain unexplored. Therefore, we present a Pseudo Depth Diffusion Model (PDDM) that adopts a large-scale text-image diffusion model as a feature extractor and a simple yet effective fusion strategy to integrate pseudo depth. To verify the applicability of pseudo depth and our PDDM, we perform extensive experiments on the NYUv2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that pseudo depth can effectively enhance segmentation performance, and our PDDM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by +6.98 mIoU on NYUv2 and +2.11 mIoU on SUNRGB-D.</p></details> |  |

However, current text-to-video generation models still face significant challenges such as high training costs, substantial data requirements, and difficulties in maintaining consistency between given text and motion of the foreground object. To address these challenges, we propose mask-guided video generation, which can control video generation through mask motion sequences, while requiring limited training data. Our model enhances existing architectures by incorporating foreground masks for precise text-position matching and motion trajectory control. Through mask motion sequences, we guide the video generation process to maintain consistent foreground objects throughout the sequence. Additionally, through a first-frame sharing strategy and autoregressive extension approach, we achieve more stable and longer video generation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that this approach excels in various video generation tasks, such as video editing and generating artistic videos, outperforming previous methods in terms of consistency and quality.

However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits superior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised labels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Our key idea is to represent 3D garment deformations as a 2D layout-consistent texture that encodes 3D offsets with respect to a parametric garment template. Using this representation, we encode a large dataset of garments simulated in various motions and shapes and train a novel conditional diffusion model that is able to synthesize high-quality pose-shape-and-design dependent 3D garment deformations. Since our model is generative, we can synthesize various plausible deformations for a given target pose, shape, and design. Additionally, we show that we can further condition our model using an existing garment state, which enables the generation of temporally coherent sequences.</p></details> | BMVC 2024 |

Existing techniques addressing these issues for responsible T2I models aim for the generated content to be fair and safe (non-violent/explicit). However, these methods remain bounded to handling the facets of responsibility concepts individually, while also lacking in interpretability. Moreover, they often require alteration to the original model, which compromises the model performance. In this work, we propose a unique technique to enable responsible T2I generation by simultaneously accounting for an extensive range of concepts for fair and safe content generation in a scalable manner. The key idea is to distill the target T2I pipeline with an external plug-and-play mechanism that learns an interpretable composite responsible space for the desired concepts, conditioned on the target T2I pipeline. We use knowledge distillation and concept whitening to enable this. At inference, the learned space is utilized to modulate the generative content. A typical T2I pipeline presents two plug-in points for our approach, namely; the text embedding space and the diffusion model latent space. We develop modules for both points and show the effectiveness of our approach with a range of strong results.</p></details> |  |

Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 camera-ready version.

Previous methods have adopted B\'ezier curves to simulate the palm creases, which then serve as input for conditional GANs to generate realistic palmprints. However, without employing real data fine-tuning, the performance of the recognition model trained on these synthetic datasets would drastically decline, indicating a large gap between generated and real palmprints. This is primarily due to the utilization of an inaccurate palm crease representation and challenges in balancing intra-class variation with identity consistency. To address this, we introduce a polynomial-based palm crease representation that provides a new palm crease generation mechanism more closely aligned with the real distribution. We also propose the palm creases conditioned diffusion model with a novel intra-class variation control method. By applying our proposed $K$-step noise-sharing sampling, we are able to synthesize palmprint datasets with large intra-class variation and high identity consistency. Experimental results show that, for the first time, recognition models trained solely on our synthetic datasets, without any fine-tuning, outperform those trained on real datasets. Furthermore, our approach achieves superior recognition performance as the number of generated identities increases.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Trajectory recovery aims to recover these missing trajectory points, making the trajectories denser and more complete. However, this task faces two key challenges: 1) The excessive sparsity of individual trajectories makes it difficult to effectively leverage historical information for recovery; 2) Sparse trajectories make it harder to capture complex individual mobility preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called DiffMove. Firstly, we harness crowd wisdom for trajectory recovery. Specifically, we construct a group tendency graph using the collective trajectories of all users and then integrate the group mobility trends into the location representations via graph embedding. This solves the challenge of sparse trajectories being unable to rely on individual historical trajectories for recovery. Secondly, we capture individual mobility preferences from both historical and current perspectives. Finally, we integrate group mobility tendencies and individual preferences into the spatiotemporal distribution of the trajectory to recover high-quality trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DiffMove outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis validates the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps.

However, existing 3D generative models often produce overly dense and unstructured meshes, which stand in stark contrast to the compact, structured, and sharply-edged Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models crafted by human designers. To address this gap, we introduce CADDreamer, a novel approach for generating boundary representations (B-rep) of CAD objects from a single image. CADDreamer employs a primitive-aware multi-view diffusion model that captures both local geometric details and high-level structural semantics during the generation process. By encoding primitive semantics into the color domain, the method leverages the strong priors of pre-trained diffusion models to align with well-defined primitives. This enables the inference of multi-view normal maps and semantic maps from a single image, facilitating the reconstruction of a mesh with primitive labels. Furthermore, we introduce geometric optimization techniques and topology-preserving extraction methods to mitigate noise and distortion in the generated primitives. These enhancements result in a complete and seamless B-rep of the CAD model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively recovers high-quality CAD objects from single-view images.

However, due to its NP-hard nature, traditional A* approaches often suffer from scalability issue, making them computationally intractable for large graphs. Many recent deep learning frameworks address GED by formulating it as a regression task, which, while efficient, fails to recover the edit path -- a central interest in GED. Furthermore, recent hybrid approaches that combine deep learning with traditional methods to recover the edit path often yield poor solution quality. These methods also struggle to generate candidate solutions in parallel, resulting in increased running times.In this paper, we present a novel approach, DiffGED, that leverages generative diffusion model to solve GED and recover the corresponding edit path. Specifically, we first generate multiple diverse node matching matrices in parallel through a diffusion-based graph matching model. Next, node mappings are extracted from each generated matching matrices in parallel, and each extracted node mapping can be simply transformed into an edit path. Benefiting from the generative diversity provided by the diffusion model, DiffGED is less likely to fall into local sub-optimal solutions, thereby achieving superior overall solution quality close to the exact solution. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that DiffGED can generate multiple diverse edit paths with exceptionally high accuracy comparable to exact solutions while maintaining a running time shorter than most of hybrid approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the compression process of LDM often results in the deterioration of details, particularly in sensitive areas such as facial features and clothing textures. In this paper, we propose a Multi-focal Conditioned Latent Diffusion (MCLD) method to address these limitations by conditioning the model on disentangled, pose-invariant features from these sensitive regions. Our approach utilizes a multi-focal condition aggregation module, which effectively integrates facial identity and texture-specific information, enhancing the model's ability to produce appearance realistic and identity-consistent images. Our method demonstrates consistent identity and appearance generation on the DeepFashion dataset and enables flexible person image editing due to its generation consistency.

Recent research has explored large-scale supervised training to enable segmentation across various medical imaging modalities and unsupervised training to facilitate segmentation without dense annotations. However, constructing a model capable of segmenting diverse medical images in a zero-shot manner without any annotations remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot Unsupervised System (ADZUS), a novel approach that leverages self-attention diffusion models for zero-shot biomedical image segmentation. ADZUS harnesses the intrinsic capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models, utilizing their generative and discriminative potentials to segment medical images without requiring annotated training data or prior domain-specific knowledge. The ADZUS architecture is detailed, with its integration of self-attention mechanisms that facilitate context-aware and detail-sensitive segmentations being highlighted. Experimental results across various medical imaging datasets, including skin lesion segmentation, chest X-ray infection segmentation, and white blood cell segmentation, reveal that ADZUS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, ADZUS reached Dice scores ranging from 88.7\% to 92.9\% and IoU scores from 66.3\% to 93.3\% across different segmentation tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in handling novel, unseen medical imagery. It is noteworthy that while ADZUS demonstrates high effectiveness, it demands substantial computational resources and extended processing times. The model's efficacy in zero-shot settings underscores its potential to reduce reliance on costly annotations and seamlessly adapt to new medical imaging tasks, thereby expanding the diagnostic capabilities of AI-driven medical imaging technologies.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional methods mainly focus on learning a deterministic mapping from speech to animation. Recent approaches start to consider the nondeterministic fact of speech-driven 3D face animation and employ the diffusion model for the task. Existing diffusion-based methods can improve the diversity of facial animation. However, personalized speaking styles conveying accurate lip language is still lacking, besides, efficiency and compactness still need to be improved. In this work, we propose DiffusionTalker to address the above limitations via personalizer-guided distillation. In terms of personalization, we introduce a contrastive personalizer that learns identity and emotion embeddings to capture speaking styles from audio. We further propose a personalizer enhancer during distillation to enhance the influence of embeddings on facial animation. For efficiency, we use iterative distillation to reduce the steps required for animation generation and achieve more than 8x speedup in inference. To achieve compactness, we distill the large teacher model into a smaller student model, reducing our model's storage by 86.4\% while minimizing performance loss. After distillation, users can derive their identity and emotion embeddings from audio to quickly create personalized animations that reflect specific speaking styles. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes. This paper presents TexGaussian, a novel method that uses octant-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid PBR material generation. Specifically, we place each 3D Gaussian on the finest leaf node of the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multi-view images not only for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our method synthesizes more visually pleasing PBR materials and runs faster than previous methods in both unconditional and text-conditional scenarios, exhibiting better consistency with the given geometry.

Existing methods approach it either via grid-based classification or via image retrieval. Their performance significantly suffers when the spatial distribution of test images does not align with such choices. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage diffusion as a mechanism for image geolocalization. To avoid the problematic manifold reprojection step in diffusion, we developed a novel spherical positional encoding-decoding framework, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking. We call this type of position encoding Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representation. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture called CS-UNet to learn the conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. We train a conditional latent diffusion model called LocDiffusion that generates geolocations under the guidance of images -- to the best of our knowledge, the first generative model for image geolocalization by diffusing geolocation information in a hidden location embedding space. We evaluate our method against SOTA image geolocalization baselines. LocDiffusion achieves competitive geolocalization performance and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations.</p></details> |  |

CFG combines the conditional score (e.g., text-conditioned) with the unconditional score to control the output. However, the unconditional score is in charge of estimating the transition between manifolds of adjacent timesteps from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$, which may inadvertently interfere with the trajectory toward the specific condition. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a geometric perspective on the unconditional score to enhance CFG performance when conditional scores are available. Specifically, we propose a method that filters the singular vectors of both conditional and unconditional scores using singular value decomposition. This filtering process aligns the unconditional score with the conditional score, thereby refining the sampling trajectory to stay closer to the manifold. Our approach improves image quality with negligible additional computation. We provide deeper insights into the score function behavior in diffusion models and present a practical technique for achieving more accurate and contextually coherent image synthesis.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

Additionally, the indeterminacy can be further exacerbated by issues such as occlusions and cluttered backgrounds. To handle such a challenging task, in this work, we begin with a key observation: the output of HOI detection for each human-object pair can be recast as an image. Thus, inspired by the strong image generation capabilities of image diffusion models, we propose a new framework, HOI-IDiff. In HOI-IDiff, we tackle HOI detection from a novel perspective, using an Image-like Diffusion process to generate HOI detection outputs as images. Furthermore, recognizing that our recast images differ in certain properties from natural images, we enhance our framework with a customized HOI diffusion process and a slice patchification model architecture, which are specifically tailored to generate our recast ``HOI images''.

Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures.

We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100).

Most existing learning-based compression methods handle geometry and color attributes separately, treating them as distinct tasks, making these methods challenging to apply directly to point clouds with colors. Besides, the limited capacities of training datasets also limit their generalizability across points with different distributions. In this work, we introduce a test-time unified geometry and color compression framework of 3D point clouds. Instead of training a compression model based on specific datasets, we adapt a pre-trained generative diffusion model to compress original colored point clouds into sparse sets, termed 'seeds', using prompt tuning. Decompression is then achieved through multiple denoising steps with separate sampling processes. Experiments on objects and indoor scenes demonstrate that our method has superior performances compared to existing baselines for the compression of geometry and color.</p></details> |  |

However, full-body reconstruction from a monocular RGB image remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem and sophisticated clothing topology with self-occlusions. In this paper, we propose PSHuman, a novel framework that explicitly reconstructs human meshes utilizing priors from the multiview diffusion model. It is found that directly applying multiview diffusion on single-view human images leads to severe geometric distortions, especially on generated faces. To address it, we propose a cross-scale diffusion that models the joint probability distribution of global full-body shape and local facial characteristics, enabling detailed and identity-preserved novel-view generation without any geometric distortion. Moreover, to enhance cross-view body shape consistency of varied human poses, we condition the generative model on parametric models like SMPL-X, which provide body priors and prevent unnatural views inconsistent with human anatomy. Leveraging the generated multi-view normal and color images, we present SMPLX-initialized explicit human carving to recover realistic textured human meshes efficiently.

Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. We accomplish this by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. We then show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments.

Specifically, classifiers are able to consistently and effortlessly distinguish real images from generated ones across various settings. Moreover, we uncover an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can easily differentiate between diffusion models with comparable performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to distinguish between models within the same family but of different scales (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL). Our methodology carries several important implications. First, it naturally serves as a diagnostic tool for diffusion models by analyzing specific features of generated data.

We use normalizing flows to parameterize the noisy data at any arbitrary step of the diffusion process and utilize it as the prior in the reverse diffusion process. More specifically, the forward noising process turns a data distribution into partially noisy data, which are subsequently transformed into a Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear process. The backward denoising procedure begins with a prior created by sampling from the Gaussian distribution and applying the invertible normalizing flow transformations deterministically. To generate the data distribution, the prior then undergoes the remaining diffusion stochastic denoising procedure. Through the reduction of the number of total diffusion steps, we are able to speed up both the forward and backward processes. More importantly, we improve the expressive power of diffusion models by employing both deterministic and stochastic mappings. Experiments on standard image generation datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, for example, we achieve an FID of 2.01 and an Inception score of 9.96.

For years, image coding focused on human perception has been well-studied, leading to the development of various image compression standards. On the other hand, with the rapid advancements in image recognition models, image compression for AI tasks, known as Image Coding for Machines (ICM), has gained significant importance. Therefore, scalable image coding techniques that address the needs of both machines and humans have become a key area of interest. Additionally, there is increasing demand for research applying the diffusion model, which can generate human-viewable images from a small amount of data to image compression methods for human vision. Image compression methods that use diffusion models can partially reconstruct the target image by guiding the generation process with a small amount of conditioning information. Inspired by the diffusion model's potential, we propose a method for extending machine vision to human visual perception using guided diffusion. Utilizing the diffusion model guided by the output of the ICM method, we generate images for human perception from random noise. Guided diffusion acts as a bridge between machine vision and human vision, enabling transitions between them without any additional bitrate overhead. The generated images then evaluated based on bitrate and image quality, and we compare their compression performance with other scalable image coding methods for humans and machines.</p></details> |  |

Classic physically-based rendering (PBR) accurately simulates the light transport, but relies on precise scene representations--explicit 3D geometry, high-quality material properties, and lighting conditions--that are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce DiffusionRenderer, a neural approach that addresses the dual problem of inverse and forward rendering within a holistic framework. Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse rendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos, providing an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the rendering model. Conversely, our rendering model generates photorealistic images from G-buffers without explicit light transport simulation. Experiments demonstrate that DiffusionRenderer effectively approximates inverse and forwards rendering, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our model enables practical applications from a single video input--including relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; project page: research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/DiffusionRenderer/</p></details> |

Compared to pixel-space models that are trained end-to-end, latent models are perceived to be more efficient and to produce higher image quality at high resolution. Here we challenge these notions, and show that pixel-space models can be very competitive to latent models both in quality and efficiency, achieving 1.5 FID on ImageNet512 and new SOTA results on ImageNet128, ImageNet256 and Kinetics600. We present a simple recipe for scaling end-to-end pixel-space diffusion models to high resolutions. 1: Use the sigmoid loss-weighting (Kingma & Gao, 2023) with our prescribed hyper-parameters. 2: Use our simplified memory-efficient architecture with fewer skip-connections. 3: Scale the model to favor processing the image at a high resolution with fewer parameters, rather than using more parameters at a lower resolution. Combining these with guidance intervals, we obtain a family of pixel-space diffusion models we call Simpler Diffusion (SiD2).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

In this work, we facilitate complex 2D X-ray image to 3D CT mapping by incorporating new view synthesis, and reduce the learning difficulty through view-guided feature alignment. Specifically, we propose a dual-view guided diffusion model (DVG-Diffusion), which couples a real input X-ray view and a synthesized new X-ray view to jointly guide CT reconstruction. First, a novel view parameter-guided encoder captures features from X-rays that are spatially aligned with CT. Next, we concatenate the extracted dual-view features as conditions for the latent diffusion model to learn and refine the CT latent representation. Finally, the CT latent representation is decoded into a CT volume in pixel space. By incorporating view parameter guided encoding and dual-view guided CT reconstruction, our DVG-Diffusion can achieve an effective balance between high fidelity and perceptual quality for CT reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Based on experiments, the comprehensive analysis and discussions for views and reconstruction are also presented.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models lack fine-grained control over camera movement, which is critical for downstream applications related to content creation, visual effects, and 3D vision. Recently, new methods demonstrate the ability to generate videos with controllable camera poses these techniques leverage pre-trained U-Net-based diffusion models that explicitly disentangle spatial and temporal generation. Still, no existing approach enables camera control for new, transformer-based video diffusion models that process spatial and temporal information jointly. Here, we propose to tame video transformers for 3D camera control using a ControlNet-like conditioning mechanism that incorporates spatiotemporal camera embeddings based on Pl\"ucker coordinates. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for controllable video generation after fine-tuning on the RealEstate10K dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to enable camera control for transformer-based video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Project Page: https://snap-research.github.io/vd3d/</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle with such alignment issues, often resulting in misalignment and penetration artifacts. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework that attempts to precisely align hand poses and interactions by synergistically integrating foundation model-driven 2D priors with diffusion-based interaction refinement for occlusion-resistant two-hand reconstruction. First, we introduce a Fusion Alignment Encoder that learns to align fused multimodal priors keypoints, segmentation maps, and depth cues from foundation models during training. This provides robust structured guidance, further enabling efficient inference without foundation models at test time while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy. Second, we employ a two-hand diffusion model explicitly trained to transform interpenetrated poses into plausible, non-penetrated interactions, leveraging gradient-guided denoising to correct artifacts and ensure realistic spatial relations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on InterHand2.6M, FreiHAND, and HIC datasets, significantly advancing occlusion handling and interaction robustness.</p></details> |  |

While high-quality visual text generation has become available with the advanced generative capabilities of diffusion models, these models often produce distorted text and inharmonious text background when given slanted or curved text layouts due to training data limitation. In this paper, we introduce a new training-free framework, STGen, which accurately generates visual texts in challenging scenarios (\eg, slanted or curved text layouts) while harmonizing them with the text background. Our framework decomposes the visual text generation process into two branches: (i) \textbf{Semantic Rectification Branch}, which leverages the ability in generating flat but accurate visual texts of the model to guide the generation of challenging scenarios. The generated latent of flat text is abundant in accurate semantic information related both to the text itself and its background. By incorporating this, we rectify the semantic information of the texts and harmonize the integration of the text with its background in complex layouts. (ii) \textbf{Structure Injection Branch}, which reinforces the visual text structure during inference. We incorporate the latent information of the glyph image, rich in glyph structure, as a new condition to further strengthen the text structure. To enhance image harmony, we also apply an effective combination method to merge the priors, providing a solid foundation for generation. Extensive experiments across a variety of visual text layouts demonstrate that our framework achieves superior accuracy and outstanding quality.</p></details> |  |

Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods are mostly limited to a single object; directly applying such methods to compositional multi-object scenarios yields inferior results, especially incorrect object placement and inconsistent shape and appearance under novel views. How to enhance and systematically evaluate the cross-view consistency of such models remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose MOVIS to enhance the structural awareness of the view-conditioned diffusion model for multi-object NVS in terms of model inputs, auxiliary tasks, and training strategy. First, we inject structure-aware features, including depth and object mask, into the denoising U-Net to enhance the model's comprehension of object instances and their spatial relationships. Second, we introduce an auxiliary task requiring the model to simultaneously predict novel view object masks, further improving the model's capability in differentiating and placing objects. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the diffusion sampling process and carefully devise a structure-guided timestep sampling scheduler during training, which balances the learning of global object placement and fine-grained detail recovery. To systematically evaluate the plausibility of synthesized images, we propose to assess cross-view consistency and novel view object placement alongside existing image-level NVS metrics. Extensive experiments on challenging synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and produces consistent novel view synthesis, highlighting its potential to guide future 3D-aware multi-object NVS tasks.

Although existing personalization methods are able to alter the subjects' positions or to personalize multiple subjects simultaneously, they often struggle to modify the behaviors of subjects or their dynamic interactions. The difficulty is attributable to overfitting to reference images, which worsens if only a single reference image is available. We propose DynASyn, an effective multi-subject personalization from a single reference image addressing these challenges. DynASyn preserves the subject identity in the personalization process by aligning concept-based priors with subject appearances and actions. This is achieved by regularizing the attention maps between the subject token and images through concept-based priors. In addition, we propose concept-based prompt-and-image augmentation for an enhanced trade-off between identity preservation and action diversity. We adopt an SDE-based editing guided by augmented prompts to generate diverse appearances and actions while maintaining identity consistency in the augmented images. Experiments show that DynASyn is capable of synthesizing highly realistic images of subjects with novel contexts and dynamic interactions with the surroundings, and outperforms baseline methods in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two key abnormalities compared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where backdoor prompts tend to generate images with similar semantic content even with significant textual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency, where the trigger induces consistent structural responses in the cross-attention maps. These consistencies leave detectable traces for defenders, making backdoors easier to identify. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor samples, we propose a novel Invisible Backdoor Attack (IBA) by explicitly mitigating these consistencies. Specifically, our approach leverages syntactic structures as backdoor triggers to amplify the sensitivity to textual variations, effectively breaking down the semantic consistency. Besides, a regularization method based on Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KMMD) is proposed to align the distribution of cross-attention responses between backdoor and benign samples, thereby disrupting attention consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IBA achieves a 97.5% attack success rate while exhibiting stronger resistance to defenses, with an average of over 98% backdoor samples bypassing three state-of-the-art detection mechanisms.

Albeit its demonstrated agility, traditional Model-Free RL (MFRL) solutions struggle to tackle the huge action space, which generally explodes exponentially along with the number of resource allocation units, enduring low sampling efficiency and high interaction cost. In contrast to MFRL, Model-Based RL (MBRL) offers an alternative solution to boost sample efficiency and stabilize the training by explicitly leveraging a learned environment model. However, establishing an accurate dynamic model for complex and noisy environments necessitates a careful balance between model accuracy and computational complexity $\&$ stability. To address these issues, we propose a Conditional Diffusion Model Planner (CDMP) for high-dimensional offline resource allocation in clustered ad hoc networks. By leveraging the astonishing generative capability of Diffusion Models (DMs), our approach enables the accurate modeling of high-quality environmental dynamics while leveraging an inverse dynamics model to plan a superior policy. Beyond simply adopting DMs in offline RL, we further incorporate the CDMP algorithm with a theoretically guaranteed, uncertainty-aware penalty metric, which theoretically and empirically manifests itself in mitigating the Out-of-Distribution (OOD)-induced distribution shift issue underlying scarce training data. Extensive experiments also show that our model outperforms MFRL in average reward and Quality of Service (QoS) while demonstrating comparable performance to other MBRL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others.

In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods.

However, existing models often neglect the relationships between customized objects in generated images. In contrast, this work addresses this gap by focusing on relation-aware customized image generation, which seeks to preserve the identities from image prompts while maintaining the relationship specified in text prompts. Specifically, we introduce DreamRelation, a framework that disentangles identity and relation learning using a carefully curated dataset. Our training data consists of relation-specific images, independent object images containing identity information, and text prompts to guide relation generation. Then, we propose two key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and natural relationships, especially when significant pose adjustments are required, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we introduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in adjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we incorporate local features of the image prompts to better distinguish between objects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on our proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamRelation in generating precise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of objects and relationships.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Nevertheless, most existing work adopts an autoencoder framework to optimize conventional criteria such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) which do not suffice to maintain the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Such an issue is more prominent under stringent bandwidth constraints or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages the prior knowledge of the pre-trained Statble Diffusion model to produce high-realism images via the conditional diffusion denoising process. Our DiffJSCC first extracts multimodal spatial and textual features from the noisy channel symbols in the generation phase. Then, it produces an initial reconstructed image as an intermediate representation to aid robust feature extraction and a stable training process. In the following diffusion step, DiffJSCC uses the derived multimodal features, together with channel state information such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as conditions to guide the denoising diffusion process, which converts the initial random noise to the final reconstruction. DiffJSCC employs a novel control module to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model and adjust it to the multimodal conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets reveal that our method significantly surpasses prior deep JSCC approaches on both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance, showcasing its ability to preserve the semantics of the original transmitted images. Notably, DiffJSCC can achieve highly realistic reconstructions for 768x512 pixel Kodak images with only 3072 symbols (<0.008 symbols per pixel) under 1dB SNR channels.</p></details> |  |

However, CFG requires several denoising passes in each time step, e.g., up to three passes in image editing tasks, resulting in excessive computational costs. This paper introduces a novel conditioning technique to ease the computational burden of the well-established guidance techniques, thereby significantly improving the inference time of diffusion models. We present Explicit Conditioning (EC) of the noise distribution on the input modalities to achieve this. Intuitively, we model the noise to guide the conditional diffusion model during the diffusion process. We present evaluations on image editing tasks and demonstrate that EC outperforms CFG in generating diverse high-quality images with significantly reduced computations.</p></details> |  |

Although motion generation has been extensively studied, most methods do not support ``embodied intelligence'' due to their offline setting, slow speed, limited motion lengths, or unnatural movements. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRIMAL, an autoregressive diffusion model that is learned with a two-stage paradigm, inspired by recent advances in foundation models. In the pretraining stage, the model learns motion dynamics from a large number of sub-second motion segments, providing ``motor primitives'' from which more complex motions are built. In the adaptation phase, we employ a ControlNet-like adaptor to fine-tune the motor control for semantic action generation and spatial target reaching. Experiments show that physics effects emerge from our training. Given a single-frame initial state, our model not only generates unbounded, realistic, and controllable motion, but also enables the avatar to be responsive to induced impulses in real time. In addition, we can effectively and efficiently adapt our base model to few-shot personalized actions and the task of spatial control. Evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We leverage the model to create a real-time character animation system in Unreal Engine that is highly responsive and natural.

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to assist in triaging benign vs malignant skin lesions and improve diagnostic accuracy. However, existing AI models for skin disease diagnosis are often developed and tested on limited and biased datasets, leading to poor performance on certain skin tones. To address this problem, we propose a novel generative model, named DermDiff, that can generate diverse and representative dermoscopic image data for skin disease diagnosis. Leveraging text prompting and multimodal image-text learning, DermDiff improves the representation of underrepresented groups (patients, diseases, etc.) in highly imbalanced datasets. Our extensive experimentation showcases the effectiveness of DermDiff in terms of high fidelity and diversity. Furthermore, downstream evaluation suggests the potential of DermDiff in mitigating racial biases for dermatology diagnosis.

However, the advancement of T2I diffusion models presents significant risks, as the models could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as generating images with violence or nudity, or creating unauthorized portraits of public figures in inappropriate contexts. To mitigate these risks, concept removal methods have been proposed. These methods aim to modify diffusion models to prevent the generation of malicious and unwanted concepts. Despite these efforts, existing research faces several challenges: (1) a lack of consistent comparisons on a comprehensive dataset, (2) ineffective prompts in harmful and nudity concepts, (3) overlooked evaluation of the ability to generate the benign part within prompts containing malicious concepts. To address these gaps, we propose to benchmark the concept removal methods by introducing a new dataset, Six-CD, along with a novel evaluation metric. In this benchmark, we conduct a thorough evaluation of concept removals, with the experimental observations and discussions offering valuable insights in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

For a test-time learning method, the weights are learned during the inversion, as compared to traditional approaches which require a network to be trained using a training data set. Results for synthetic examples in seismic tomography and direct current resistivity inversions are shown first. We then perform a singular value decomposition analysis on the Jacobian of the weights of the neural network (SVD analysis) for both cases to explore the effects of neural networks on the recovered model. The results show that the test-time learning approach can eliminate unwanted artifacts in the recovered subsurface physical property model caused by the sensitivity of the survey and physics. Therefore, NFs-Inv improves the inversion results compared to the conventional inversion in some cases such as the recovery of the dip angle or the prediction of the boundaries of the main target. In the SVD analysis, we observe similar patterns in the left-singular vectors as were observed in some diffusion models, trained in a supervised manner, for generative tasks in computer vision. This observation provides evidence that there is an implicit bias, which is inherent in neural network structures, that is useful in supervised learning and test-time learning models. This implicit bias has the potential to be useful for recovering models in geophysical inversions.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this, we propose ProDehaze, a framework that employs internal image priors to direct external priors encoded in pretrained models. We introduce two types of \textit{selective} internal priors that prompt the model to concentrate on critical image areas: a Structure-Prompted Restorer in the latent space that emphasizes structure-rich regions, and a Haze-Aware Self-Correcting Refiner in the decoding process to align distributions between clearer input regions and the output. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ProDehaze achieves high-fidelity results in image dehazing, particularly in reducing color shifts.

However, the naive application of DMs presents several key limitations. (i) The diffusion prior has inferior semantic consistency (e.g., ID, structure and color.), increasing the difficulty of optimizing the BFR model; (ii) reliance on hundreds of denoising iterations, preventing the effective cooperation with perceptual losses, which is crucial for faithful restoration. Observing that the latent consistency model (LCM) learns consistency noise-to-data mappings on the ODE-trajectory and therefore shows more semantic consistency in the subject identity, structural information and color preservation, we propose InterLCM to leverage the LCM for its superior semantic consistency and efficiency to counter the above issues. Treating low-quality images as the intermediate state of LCM, InterLCM achieves a balance between fidelity and quality by starting from earlier LCM steps. LCM also allows the integration of perceptual loss during training, leading to improved restoration quality, particularly in real-world scenarios. To mitigate structural and semantic uncertainties, InterLCM incorporates a Visual Module to extract visual features and a Spatial Encoder to capture spatial details, enhancing the fidelity of restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterLCM outperforms existing approaches in both synthetic and real-world datasets while also achieving faster inference speed.</p></details> | Accepted at ICLR2025 |

The Betti number, which represents the number of structures in an image, is a fundamental measure in topology. Yet, diffusion models fail to satisfy even this basic constraint. This limitation restricts their utility in applications requiring exact control, like robotics and environmental modeling. To address this, we propose TopoDiffusionNet (TDN), a novel approach that enforces diffusion models to maintain the desired topology. We leverage tools from topological data analysis, particularly persistent homology, to extract the topological structures within an image. We then design a topology-based objective function to guide the denoising process, preserving intended structures while suppressing noisy ones. Our experiments across four datasets demonstrate significant improvements in topological accuracy.

In this work, we propose a preference-guided diffusion model that generates Pareto-optimal designs by leveraging a classifier-based guidance mechanism. Our guidance classifier is a preference model trained to predict the probability that one design dominates another, directing the diffusion model toward optimal regions of the design space. Crucially, this preference model generalizes beyond the training distribution, enabling the discovery of Pareto-optimal solutions outside the observed dataset. We introduce a novel diversity-aware preference guidance, augmenting Pareto dominance preference with diversity criteria. This ensures that generated solutions are optimal and well-distributed across the objective space, a capability absent in prior generative methods for offline multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach on various continuous offline multi-objective optimization tasks and find that it consistently outperforms other inverse/generative approaches while remaining competitive with forward/surrogate-based optimization methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion models in generating diverse and high-quality solutions that approximate the Pareto front well.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/SliMM-X/CoMP-MM</p></details> |

However, evaluating multimodality is challenging since the task is ill-posed. Therefore, we first propose an alternative paradigm to make the task well-posed. Next, while state-of-the-art methods predict multimodality, this requires oversampling a large volume of predictions. This raises key questions: (1) Can we capture multimodality by efficiently sampling a smaller number of predictions? (2) Subsequently, which of the predicted futures is more likely for an observed pose sequence? We address these questions with MotionMap, a simple yet effective heatmap based representation for multimodality. We extend heatmaps to represent a spatial distribution over the space of all possible motions, where different local maxima correspond to different forecasts for a given observation. MotionMap can capture a variable number of modes per observation and provide confidence measures for different modes. Further, MotionMap allows us to introduce the notion of uncertainty and controllability over the forecasted pose sequence. Finally, MotionMap captures rare modes that are non-trivial to evaluate yet critical for safety. We support our claims through multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments using popular 3D human pose datasets: Human3.6M and AMASS, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.

The importance of predicting carbon fluxes has led to the emerging field of data-driven carbon flux modelling (DDCFM), which uses statistical techniques to predict carbon fluxes from biophysical data. However, the field lacks a standardized dataset to promote comparisons between models. To address this gap, we present CarbonSense, the first machine learning-ready dataset for DDCFM. CarbonSense integrates measured carbon fluxes, meteorological predictors, and satellite imagery from 385 locations across the globe, offering comprehensive coverage and facilitating robust model training. Additionally, we provide a baseline model using a current state-of-the-art DDCFM approach and a novel transformer based model. Our experiments illustrate the potential gains that multimodal deep learning techniques can bring to this domain. By providing these resources, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for other deep learning researchers to develop new models and drive new advances in carbon flux modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 con...</summary><p>9 content pages, 11 reference pages, 9 appendix pages</p></details> |

Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance.

However, current agents primarily demonstrate strong understanding capabilities in static environments and are mainly applied to relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Image LLMs and Video LLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that current models struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, Video LLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Therefore, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned Video LLM, GUI-Vid, as a GUI-oriented assistant, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using video LLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding.

In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of visual-spatial reasoning, and propose a new learning task for MLLMs, termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). Different from recent visual CoT studies, which focus more on visual knowledge reasoning, GCoT is keen to helping MLLMs to recognize and ground the relevant visual cues step by step, thereby predicting the correct answer with grounding coordinates as the intuitive basis. To facilitate this task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal grounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for 5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also introduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and answer-grounding consistency. We further design and conduct a bunch of experiments on 12 advanced MLLMs, and reveal some notable findings: i. most MLLMs performs poorly on the consistency evaluation, indicating obvious visual hallucination; ii. visual hallucination is not directly related to the parameter size and general multimodal performance, i.e., a larger and stronger MLLM is not less affected by this issue. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the proposed dataset can help existing MLLMs to well cultivate their GCoT capability and reduce the inconsistent answering significantly. Moreover, their GCoT can be also generalized to exiting multimodal tasks, such as open-world QA and REC.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, as training data, it provides richer contextual reasoning information, thereby guiding the model to achieve better performance. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) primarily rely on single-turn dialogue training and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, following the characteristics of human dialogue, such as focused topics and concise, clear content, we present MMCR (Multimodal Multi-turn Contextual Reasoning), a novel dataset comprising: (1) MMCR-310k -- the largest multi-image multi-turn instruction tuning dataset with 310K contextual dialogues, each covering 1-4 images and 4 or 8 dialogue turns; and (2) MMCR-Bench -- a diagnostic benchmark featuring dialogues, spanning 8 domains (Humanities, Natural, Science, Education, etc.) and 40 sub-topics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that models fine-tuned with MMCR-310k achieve 5.2\% higher contextual accuracy on MMCR-Bench, while showing consistent improvements on existing benchmarks (+1.1\% on AI2D, +1.2\% on MMMU and MMVet).

Despite recent advances in multimodal survival models, collecting complete modalities for multimodal fusion still poses a significant challenge, hindering their application in clinical settings. Current approaches tackling incomplete modalities often fall short, as they typically compensate for only a limited part of the knowledge of missing modalities. To address this issue, we propose a Distilled Prompt Learning framework (DisPro) to utilize the strong robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to missing modalities, which employs two-stage prompting for compensation of comprehensive information for missing modalities. In the first stage, Unimodal Prompting (UniPro) distills the knowledge distribution of each modality, preparing for supplementing modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality in the subsequent stage. In the second stage, Multimodal Prompting (MultiPro) leverages available modalities as prompts for LLMs to infer the missing modality, which provides modality-common information. Simultaneously, the unimodal knowledge acquired in the first stage is injected into multimodal inference to compensate for the modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality. Extensive experiments covering various missing scenarios demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.

This redundancy greatly limits the efficient deployment of continually adaptable multimodal large language models, hindering their ability to refine existing skills and acquire new competencies over time. We reframe the problem of lifelong Instruction Tuning (LiIT) via data selection, where the model automatically selects beneficial samples to learn from earlier and new datasets based on the current state of acquired knowledge in the model. We propose Adapt-$\infty$, a new multi-way and adaptive data selection approach that dynamically balances sample efficiency and effectiveness during LiIT. We first construct pseudo-skill clusters by grouping gradient-based sample vectors. Next, we select the best-performing data selector for each skill cluster from a pool of selector experts, including our newly proposed scoring function, Image Grounding score. This data selector samples a subset of the most important samples from each skill cluster for training. To prevent the continuous increase in the size of the dataset pool during LiIT, we introduce a cluster-wise permanent data pruning strategy to remove the most semantically redundant samples from each cluster, keeping computational requirements manageable. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of Adapt-$\infty$ over a sequence of multimodal instruction tuning datasets with various tasks, including (Knowledge) VQA, multilingual, grounding, reasoning, language-only, and multi-image comprehension. Training with samples selected by Adapt-$\infty$ alleviates catastrophic forgetting, especially for rare tasks, and promotes forward transfer across the continuum using only a fraction of the original data.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

To address this challenge, our study has developed a robust model that effectively integrates multimodal sentiment information, even in the absence of text modality. Specifically, we have developed a Double-Flow Self-Distillation Framework, including Unified Modality Cross-Attention (UMCA) and Modality Imagination Autoencoder (MIA), which excels at processing both scenarios with complete modalities and those with missing text modality. In detail, when the text modality is missing, our framework uses the LLM-based model to simulate the text representation from the audio modality, while the MIA module supplements information from the other two modalities to make the simulated text representation similar to the real text representation. To further align the simulated and real representations, and to enable the model to capture the continuous nature of sample orders in sentiment valence regression tasks, we have also introduced the Rank-N Contrast (RNC) loss function. When testing on the CMU-MOSEI, our model achieved outstanding performance on MAE and significantly outperformed other models when text modality is missing.

To efficiently address GPR signal noise, we introduce an advanced feature representation called the subsurface feature matrix (SFM). The SFM leverages frequency domain data and identifies peaks within radar scans. Additionally, we propose a novel feature matching method that estimates GPR displacement by aligning SFMs. The integrations from these three input sources are consolidated using a factor graph approach to achieve multimodal robot odometry. Our method has been developed and evaluated with the CMU-GPR public dataset, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and robustness with real-time performance in robotic odometry tasks.</p></details> |  |

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021).

Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types. Each example includes standardized chart code, CSV data, and multiple-choice questions with labeled explanations, validated through multi-round MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension. We publicly release the sample dataset to support further research in this critical area.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages in total.

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation, adapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers knowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize MLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text embeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text embeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial consistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects that do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D model with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address this, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation masks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of the scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal semantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object across different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor scene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data, MLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively interpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

Though effective in mathematical problem-solving, MLLMs often struggle with the nuanced task of identifying and categorizing student errors in multimodal mathematical contexts. Therefore, we introduce MathAgent, a novel Mixture-of-Math-Agent framework designed specifically to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes error detection into three phases, each handled by a specialized agent: an image-text consistency validator, a visual semantic interpreter, and an integrative error analyzer. This architecture enables more accurate processing of mathematical content by explicitly modeling relationships between multimodal problems and student solution steps. We evaluate MathAgent on real-world educational data, demonstrating approximately 5% higher accuracy in error step identification and 3% improvement in error categorization compared to baseline models. Besides, MathAgent has been successfully deployed in an educational platform that has served over one million K-12 students, achieving nearly 90% student satisfaction while generating significant cost savings by reducing manual error detection.</p></details> | Work In Progress |

However, current algorithms typically tackle individual sub-tasks separately, which leads to low efficiency when aiming at obtaining full-perception results. Some multi-task learning methods try to unify multiple tasks with one model, but do not solve the conflicts in multi-task learning. In this paper, we introduce M3Net, a novel multimodal and multi-task network that simultaneously tackles detection, segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving and achieves superior performance than single task model. M3Net takes multimodal data as input and multiple tasks via query-token interactions. To enhance the integration of multi-modal features for multi-task learning, we first propose the Modality-Adaptive Feature Integration (MAFI) module, which enables single-modality features to predict channel-wise attention weights for their high-performing tasks, respectively. Based on integrated features, we then develop task-specific query initialization strategies to accommodate the needs of detection/segmentation and 3D occupancy prediction. Leveraging the properly initialized queries, a shared decoder transforms queries and BEV features layer-wise, facilitating multi-task learning. Furthermore, we propose a Task-oriented Channel Scaling (TCS) module in the decoder to mitigate conflicts between optimizing for different tasks. Additionally, our proposed multi-task querying and TCS module support both Transformer-based decoder and Mamba-based decoder, demonstrating its flexibility to different architectures. M3Net achieves state-of-the-art multi-task learning performance on the nuScenes benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms.

Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.</p></details> | 47 pages |

However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents has been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works predominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this challenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and uncalibrated mode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating excessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to identify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles and compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce ModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences. Unlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one shot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step, thereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and significantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging the inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the Early-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories further. Without relying on dense mode prediction or heuristic post-processing, ModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while attaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance on motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the capability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior modes when the future is highly uncertain.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

To this end, we propose a novel framework that aligns vision and language using frozen unimodal encoders. It involves selecting semantically similar encoders in the latent space, curating a concept-rich dataset of image-caption pairs, and training simple MLP projectors.

To address them, much efforts have been spent on developing novel searching operators, niching strategies and multi-objective problem transformation pipelines. Though promising, existing approaches more or less overlook the potential usage of landscape knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework tailored for MMOPs, termed as APDMMO, which facilitates peak detection via fully leveraging the landscape knowledge and hence capable of providing strong optimization performance on MMOPs. Specifically, we first design a novel surrogate landscape model which ensembles a group of non-linear activation units to improve the regression accuracy on diverse MMOPs. Then we propose a free-of-trial peak detection method which efficiently locates potential peak areas through back-propagation on the learned surrogate landscape model. Based on the detected peak areas, we employ SEP-CMAES for local search within these areas in parallel to further improve the accuracy of the found optima. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that APDMMO outperforms several up-to-date baselines. Further ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed novel designs.

However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers.

However, existing methods typically fine-tune the parameters of LMMs to learn additional segmentation tokens and overfit grounding and segmentation datasets. Such a design would inevitably cause a catastrophic diminution in the indispensable conversational capability of general AI assistants. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art grounding LMMs across a suite of multimodal question-answering benchmarks, observing drastic performance drops that indicate vanishing general knowledge comprehension and weakened instruction following ability. To address this issue, we present F-LMM -- grounding frozen off-the-shelf LMMs in human-AI conversations -- a straightforward yet effective design based on the fact that word-pixel correspondences conducive to visual grounding inherently exist in the attention mechanism of well-trained LMMs. Using only a few trainable CNN layers, we can translate word-pixel attention weights to mask logits, which a SAM-based mask refiner can further optimise. Our F-LMM neither learns special segmentation tokens nor utilises high-quality grounded instruction-tuning data, but achieves competitive performance on referring expression segmentation and panoptic narrative grounding benchmarks while completely preserving LMMs' original conversational ability. Additionally, with instruction-following ability preserved and grounding ability obtained, F-LMM can be directly applied to complex tasks like reasoning segmentation, grounded conversation generation and visual chain-of-thought reasoning.

How can we ensure that MLLMs are safely aligned to prevent undesired behaviors such as discrimination, misinformation, or violations of ethical standards? In a further step, we need to explore how to fine-tune MLLMs to enhance reasoning performance while ensuring they satisfy safety constraints. Fundamentally, this can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem. In this study, we propose Safe RLHF-V, the first multimodal safety alignment framework that jointly optimizes helpfulness and safety using separate multimodal reward and cost models within a Lagrangian-based constrained optimization framework. Given that there is a lack of preference datasets that separate helpfulness and safety in multimodal scenarios, we introduce BeaverTails-V, the first open-source dataset with dual preference annotations for helpfulness and safety, along with multi-level safety labels (minor, moderate, severe). Additionally, we design a Multi-level Guardrail System to proactively defend against unsafe queries and adversarial attacks. By applying the Beaver-Guard-V moderation for 5 rounds of filtering and re-generation on the precursor model, the overall safety of the upstream model is significantly improved by an average of 40.9%. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning different MLLMs with Safe RLHF can effectively enhance model helpfulness while ensuring improved safety. Specifically, Safe RLHF-V improves model safety by 34.2% and helpfulness by 34.3%.

X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area.

While multimodal contrastive representation learning (MCRL) has shown promise in neural decoding, existing methods often overlook semantic consistency and completeness within modalities and lack effective semantic alignment across modalities. This limits their ability to capture the complex representations of visual neural responses. We propose Neural-MCRL, a novel framework that achieves multimodal alignment through semantic bridging and cross-attention mechanisms, while ensuring completeness within modalities and consistency across modalities. Our framework also features the Neural Encoder with Spectral-Temporal Adaptation (NESTA), a EEG encoder that adaptively captures spectral patterns and learns subject-specific transformations. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in visual decoding accuracy and model generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods, advancing the field of EEG-based neural visual representation decoding in BMI.

While substantial research has focused on either the visual or textual components of memes, little attention has been given to their interplay. This gap raises a key question: What methodology can effectively compare memes and the emotions they elicit? Our study employs a multimodal methodological approach, analyzing both the visual and textual elements of memes. Specifically, we perform a multimodal CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model for grouping similar memes based on text and visual content embeddings, enabling robust similarity assessments across modalities. Using the Reddit Meme Dataset and Memotion Dataset, we extract low-level visual features and high-level semantic features to identify similar meme pairs. To validate these automated similarity assessments, we conducted a user study with 50 participants, asking them to provide yes/no responses regarding meme similarity and their emotional reactions. The comparison of experimental results with human judgments showed a 67.23\% agreement, suggesting that the computational approach aligns well with human perception. Additionally, we implemented a text-based classifier using the DistilBERT model to categorize memes into one of six basic emotions. The results indicate that anger and joy are the dominant emotions in memes, with motivational memes eliciting stronger emotional responses. This research contributes to the study of multimodal memes, enhancing both language-based and visual approaches to analyzing and improving online visual communication and user experiences. Furthermore, it provides insights for better content moderation strategies in online platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Have ...</summary><p>Have been submitted to IEEE for consideration</p></details> |

However, efficiently serving LMMs in production environments poses significant challenges due to their complex architectures and heterogeneous characteristics across their multi-stage inference pipelines. We present the first comprehensive systems analysis of two prominent LMM architectures, decoder-only and cross-attention, across six representative open-source models, revealing key systems design implications. We also present an in-depth analysis of production LMM inference traces, uncovering unique workload characteristics, including variable, heavy-tailed request distributions and bursty traffic patterns. Based on these insights, we propose ModServe, a modular LMM serving system that decouples stages for independent optimization and adaptive scaling. ModServe dynamically reconfigures stages and handles bursty traffic with modality-aware scheduling and autoscaling to meet tail latency SLOs while minimizing costs. ModServe achieves 3.3-5.5x higher throughput (leading to 25-41.3% cost saving) while meeting SLOs on a 128-GPU cluster with production traces.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

However, existing methods that rely solely on static code analysis or transactional data, offer limited insight into evolving trustworthiness. We propose a multimodal data fusion framework that integrates static code features with transactional data to enhance reputability prediction. Our framework initially focuses on static code analysis, utilizing GAN-augmented opcode embeddings to address class imbalance, achieving 97.67% accuracy and a recall of 0.942 in detecting illicit contracts, surpassing traditional oversampling methods. This forms the crux of a reputability-centric fusion strategy, where combining static and transactional data improves recall by 7.25% over single-source models, demonstrating robust performance across validation sets. By providing a holistic view of smart contract behaviour, our approach enhances the model's ability to assess reputability, identify fraudulent activities, and predict anomalous patterns. These capabilities contribute to more accurate reputability assessments, proactive risk mitigation, and enhanced blockchain security.</p></details> |  |

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM 2025 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Late Breaking Work (CHI'25 LBW)</p></details> |

While progress has been made in addressing traditional scientific problems, MSPs still face two primary issues: the challenge of multi-modal comprehensive reasoning in scientific problem-solving and the lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-Agent framework based on the Big Seven Personality and Socratic guidance (MAPS). This framework employs seven distinct agents that leverage feedback mechanisms and the Socratic method to guide the resolution of MSPs. To tackle the first issue, we propose a progressive four-agent solving strategy, where each agent focuses on a specific stage of the problem-solving process. For the second issue, we introduce a Critic agent, inspired by Socratic questioning, which prompts critical thinking and stimulates autonomous learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the EMMA, Olympiad, and MathVista datasets, achieving promising results that outperform the current SOTA model by 15.84% across all tasks. Meanwhile, the additional analytical experiments also verify the model's progress as well as generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

As an important branch, industrial image anomaly detection focuses on automatically identifying visual anomalies in industrial scenarios (such as product surface defects, assembly errors, and equipment appearance anomalies) through computer vision techniques. With the rapid development of Unsupervised industrial Image Anomaly Detection (UIAD), excellent detection performance has been achieved not only in RGB setting but also in 3D and multimodal (RGB and 3D) settings. However, existing surveys primarily focus on UIAD tasks in RGB setting, with little discussion in 3D and multimodal settings. To address this gap, this artical provides a comprehensive review of UIAD tasks in the three modal settings. Specifically, we first introduce the task concept and process of UIAD. We then overview the research on UIAD in three modal settings (RGB, 3D, and multimodal), including datasets and methods, and review multimodal feature fusion strategies in multimodal setting. Finally, we summarize the main challenges faced by UIAD tasks in the three modal settings, and offer insights into future development directions, aiming to provide researchers with a comprehensive reference and offer new perspectives for the advancement of industrial informatization.

Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently acquire specialized knowledge in MLLMs, it introduces substantial harmful redundancy during visual instruction tuning, which exacerbates the forgetting of general knowledge and degrades downstream task performance. To address this issue, we propose LoRASculpt to eliminate harmful redundant parameters, thereby harmonizing general and specialized knowledge. Specifically, under theoretical guarantees, we introduce sparse updates into LoRA to discard redundant parameters effectively. Furthermore, we propose a Conflict Mitigation Regularizer to refine the update trajectory of LoRA, mitigating knowledge conflicts with the pretrained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that even at very high degree of sparsity ($\le$ 5%), our method simultaneously enhances generalization and downstream task performance. This confirms that our approach effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting issue and further promotes knowledge harmonization in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of "dynamic" questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG.

With the rapid growth of observability techniques, various methods have been proposed to achieve failure diagnosis, including root cause localization and failure type identification, by leveraging diverse monitoring data such as logs, metrics, or traces. However, traditional failure diagnosis methods that use single-modal data can hardly cover all failure scenarios due to the restricted information. Several failure diagnosis methods have been recently proposed to integrate multimodal data based on deep learning. These methods, however, tend to combine modalities indiscriminately and treat them equally in failure diagnosis, ignoring the relationship between specific modalities and different diagnostic tasks. This oversight hinders the effective utilization of the unique advantages offered by each modality. To address the limitation, we propose \textit{TVDiag}, a multimodal failure diagnosis framework for locating culprit microservice instances and identifying their failure types (e.g., Net-packets Corruption) in microservice-based systems. \textit{TVDiag} employs task-oriented learning to enhance the potential advantages of each modality and establishes cross-modal associations based on contrastive learning to extract view-invariant failure information. Furthermore, we develop a graph-level data augmentation strategy that randomly inactivates the observability of some normal microservice instances during training to mitigate the shortage of training data. Experimental results show that \textit{TVDiag} outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multimodal failure diagnosis, achieving at least a 55.94\% higher $HR@1$ accuracy and over a 4.08\% increase in F1-score across two datasets.</p></details> | 32 pages |

By empowering LLMs to perceive external environments, integrate multimodal information, and interact with various tools, these agentic systems exhibit greater autonomy and adaptability across complex tasks. This evolution brings new opportunities to recommender systems (RS): LLM-based Agentic RS (LLM-ARS) can offer more interactive, context-aware, and proactive recommendations, potentially reshaping the user experience and broadening the application scope of RS. Despite promising early results, fundamental challenges remain, including how to effectively incorporate external knowledge, balance autonomy with controllability, and evaluate performance in dynamic, multimodal settings. In this perspective paper, we first present a systematic analysis of LLM-ARS: (1) clarifying core concepts and architectures; (2) highlighting how agentic capabilities -- such as planning, memory, and multimodal reasoning -- can enhance recommendation quality; and (3) outlining key research questions in areas such as safety, efficiency, and lifelong personalization. We also discuss open problems and future directions, arguing that LLM-ARS will drive the next wave of RS innovation. Ultimately, we foresee a paradigm shift toward intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative recommendation experiences that more closely align with users' evolving needs and complex decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

However, as the scale of LMMs continues to grow, fully fine-tuning these models has become highly parameter-intensive. Although Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced to reduce the number of tunable parameters, a significant performance gap remains compared to full fine-tuning. Furthermore, existing PEFT approaches are often highly parameterized, making them difficult to interpret and control. In light of this, we introduce Multimodal Representation Tuning (MRT), a novel approach that focuses on directly editing semantically rich multimodal representations to achieve strong performance and provide intuitive control over LMMs. Empirical results show that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines with significant performance gains (e.g., 1580.40 MME score) while requiring substantially fewer tunable parameters (e.g., 0.03% parameters). Additionally, we conduct experiments on editing instrumental tokens within multimodal representations, demonstrating that direct manipulation of these representations enables simple yet effective control over network behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing GeoFMs primarily focus on overhead remote sensing (RS) data while neglecting other data modalities such as ground-level imagery. A key challenge in multimodal GeoFM development is to explicitly model geospatial relationships across modalities, which enables generalizability across tasks, spatial scales, and temporal contexts. To address these limitations, we propose GAIR, a novel multimodal GeoFM architecture integrating overhead RS data, street view (SV) imagery, and their geolocation metadata. We utilize three factorized neural encoders to project an SV image, its geolocation, and an RS image into the embedding space. The SV image needs to be located within the RS image's spatial footprint but does not need to be at its geographic center. In order to geographically align the SV image and RS image, we propose a novel implicit neural representations (INR) module that learns a continuous RS image representation and looks up the RS embedding at the SV image's geolocation. Next, these geographically aligned SV embedding, RS embedding, and location embedding are trained with contrastive learning objectives from unlabeled data. We evaluate GAIR across 10 geospatial tasks spanning RS image-based, SV image-based, and location embedding-based benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that GAIR outperforms state-of-the-art GeoFMs and other strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in learning generalizable and transferable geospatial representations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 homepage: https://m3-spatial-memory.github.io code: https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial</p></details> |

Yet, without vast amounts of spatial supervision, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle at this task. In this paper, we introduce TWIST & SCOUT, a framework that equips pre-trained MLLMs with visual grounding ability without forgetting their existing image and language understanding skills. To this end, we propose TWIST, a twin-expert stepwise tuning module that modifies the decoder of the language model using one frozen module pre-trained on image understanding tasks and another learnable one for visual grounding tasks. This allows the MLLM to retain previously learned knowledge and skills, while acquiring what is missing. To fine-tune the model effectively, we generate a high-quality synthetic dataset we call SCOUT, which mimics human reasoning in visual grounding. This dataset provides rich supervision signals, describing a step-by-step multimodal reasoning process, thereby simplifying the task of visual grounding. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets, encompassing grounded image captioning, zero-shot localization, and visual grounding tasks. Our method consistently delivers strong performance across all tasks, while retaining the pre-trained image understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel and efficient pose-driven attention-guided multimodal network (EPAM-Net) for action recognition in videos. Specifically, we propose eXpand temporal Shift (X-ShiftNet) convolutional architectures for RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. The X-ShiftNet tackles the high computational cost of the 3D CNNs by integrating the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) into an efficient 2D CNN, enabling efficient spatiotemporal learning. Then skeleton features are utilized to guide the visual network stream, focusing on keyframes and their salient spatial regions using the proposed spatial-temporal attention block. Finally, the predictions of the two streams are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method, with a significant reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), outperforms and competes with the state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB-D 60, NTU RGB-D 120, PKU-MMD, and Toyota SmartHome datasets. The proposed EPAM-Net provides up to a 72.8x reduction in FLOPs and up to a 48.6x reduction in the number of network parameters.

LMs have a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including autocomplete and machine translation. Although larger datasets typically enhance LM performance, scalability remains a challenge due to constraints in computational power and resources. Distributed computing strategies offer essential solutions for improving scalability and managing the growing computational demand. Further, the use of sensitive datasets in training and deployment raises significant privacy concerns. Recent research has focused on developing decentralized techniques to enable distributed training and inference while utilizing diverse computational resources and enabling edge AI. This paper presents a survey on distributed solutions for various LMs, including large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and small language models (SLMs). While LLMs focus on processing and generating text, MLLMs are designed to handle multiple modalities of data (e.g., text, images, and audio) and to integrate them for broader applications. To this end, this paper reviews key advancements across the MLLM pipeline, including distributed training, inference, fine-tuning, and deployment, while also identifying the contributions, limitations, and future areas of improvement. Further, it categorizes the literature based on six primary focus areas of decentralization. Our analysis describes gaps in current methodologies for enabling distributed solutions for LMs and outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for novel solutions to enhance the robustness and applicability of distributed LMs.</p></details> |  |

This dataset includes electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and pulse interval (PI) from 64 participants. Data collection employed two emotion induction paradigms: video stimuli that targeted different valence levels (positive, neutral, and negative) and the Mannheim Multicomponent Stress Test (MMST), which induced high arousal through cognitive, emotional, and social stressors. To enrich the dataset, participants' personality traits, anxiety, depression, and emotional states were assessed using validated questionnaires. By capturing a broad spectrum of affective responses while accounting for individual differences, this dataset provides a robust resource for precise emotion modeling. The integration of multimodal physiological data with psychological assessments lays a strong foundation for personalized emotion recognition.

Existing unimodal datasets lack scale and diversity, limiting deep learning solutions. This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching framework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps. Our contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233 sampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels). After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability. This work addresses longstanding challenges in MRSI matching by combining scalable dataset construction with a robust, semantics-driven framework. Furthermore, MapGlue shows strong generalization capabilities on other modality matching tasks for which it was not specifically trained.

In this paper, we disclose that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its excessive encoding of class-irrelevant features, which can compromise the model's visual feature resistivity to input perturbations, making it more susceptible to capturing the trigger patterns inserted by backdoor attacks. Inspired by this finding, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs specially designed deep visual prompt tuning and feature-repelling loss to eliminate excessive class-irrelevant features while simultaneously optimizing cross-entropy loss to maintain clean accuracy. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters relative to CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing the attack success rate from 67.53\% to 2.76\% against SoTA attacks and effectively generalizing its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Despite the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these limitations, it faces two issues: (1) its generalized capabilities in multimodal tasks remain underexplored. (2) its training constraints such as constant Kullback-Leibler or clamp strategy easily lead to suboptimal bottleneck. To adress these issues, we introduce OThink-MR1, a framework that extends RL to MLLMs, enabling them to achieve deeper understanding and reasoning across multimodal tasks. We design a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy that significantly enhances RL performance, surpassing SFT in same-task evaluations. Also, we are the first to reveal that RL exhibits remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, which shows that models post-trained with RL on one multimodal task can be effectively transfered to another tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the great reasoning ability of our proposed OThink-MR1.</p></details> |  |

They have pictorial ideographic features, and their symbols carry rich cultural and contextual information. Due to the lack of relevant datasets, existing research has difficulty in advancing the study of semantic understanding of Dongba pictographs. To this end, we propose \textbf{DongbaMIE}, the first multimodal dataset for semantic understanding and extraction of Dongba pictographs, consisting of Dongba pictograph images and corresponding Chinese semantic annotations. DongbaMIE contains 23,530 sentence-level and 2,539 paragraph-level images, covering four semantic dimensions: objects, actions, relations, and attributes. We systematically evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0, and Qwen2-VL. Experimental results show that best F1 scores of proprietary models, GPT-4o and Gemini, for object extraction task are only 3.16 and 3.11 respectively. For the open-source model Qwen2-VL, it achieves only 11.49 after supervised fine-tuning.

However, multimodal frameworks often entangle these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressing discriminative features. To address this, we propose Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis. Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening. Future work will focus on improving the detection of subtle pathologies and addressing dataset biases to enhance its generalizability and application in diverse global healthcare settings.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges.

This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4V) in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Furthermore, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies.

This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality.

Existing KD-based methods for multimodal AD that use fused multimodal features to obtain teacher representations face challenges. Anomalies in one modality may not be effectively captured in the fused teacher features, leading to detection failures. Besides, these methods do not fully leverage the rich intra- and inter-modality information. In this paper, we propose Crossmodal Reverse Distillation (CRD) based on Multi-branch design to realize Multimodal Industrial AD. By assigning independent branches to each modality, our method enables finer detection of anomalies within each modality. Furthermore, we enhance the interaction between modalities during the distillation process by designing Crossmodal Filter and Amplifier. With the idea of crossmodal mapping, the student network is allowed to better learn normal features while anomalies in all modalities are ensured to be effectively detected. Experimental verifications on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal anomaly detection and localization.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants.

We introduce ViBe (https://vibe-t2v-bench.github.io/): a large-scale dataset of hallucinated videos from open-source T2V models. We identify five major hallucination types: Vanishing Subject, Omission Error, Numeric Variability, Subject Dysmorphia, and Visual Incongruity. Using ten T2V models, we generated and manually annotated 3,782 videos from 837 diverse MS COCO captions. Our proposed benchmark includes a dataset of hallucinated videos and a classification framework using video embeddings. ViBe serves as a critical resource for evaluating T2V reliability and advancing hallucination detection. We establish classification as a baseline, with the TimeSFormer + CNN ensemble achieving the best performance (0.345 accuracy, 0.342 F1 score).

However, traditional mapping methods are labor-intensive, limiting spatial coverage and introducing potential biases. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthScape, a novel, AI-ready multimodal dataset specifically designed for surficial geologic mapping and Earth surface analysis. EarthScape integrates high-resolution aerial RGB and near-infrared (NIR) imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), multi-scale DEM-derived terrain features, and hydrologic and infrastructure vector data. The dataset provides detailed annotations for seven distinct surficial geologic classes encompassing various geological processes. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline using open-sourced raw data and establish baseline benchmarks using different spatial modalities to demonstrate the utility of EarthScape. As a living dataset with a vision for expansion, EarthScape bridges the gap between computer vision and Earth sciences, offering a valuable resource for advancing research in multimodal learning, geospatial analysis, and geological mapping.

| **[Real-world validation of a multimodal LLM-powered pipeline for High-Accuracy Clinical Trial Patient Matching leveraging EHR data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15374v1)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15374v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex eligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews. Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data. Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials. Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews. Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.</p></details> |  |

We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that under certain conditions perfect alignment can be achieved. We then address a specific application of alignment referred to as cross-modal transfer. Unsupervised cross-modal transfer aims to leverage a model trained with one modality to perform inference on another modality, without any labeled fine-tuning on the new modality. Assuming that semantic classes are represented as a mixture of Gaussians in the latent space, we show how cross-modal transfer can be performed by projecting the data points from the representation space onto different subspaces representing each modality. Our experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment and cross-modal transfer method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of the applications of perfect alignment and the use of Gaussian models for cross-modal learning.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and robust registration methods are essential for aligning data from different modalities, forming the foundation for multimodal sensor data fusion and enhancing perception systems' accuracy and reliability. The registration task between 2D images captured by cameras and 3D point clouds captured by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors is usually treated as a visual pose estimation problem. High-dimensional feature similarities from different modalities are leveraged to identify pixel-point correspondences, followed by pose estimation techniques using least squares methods. However, existing approaches often resort to downsampling the original point cloud and image data due to computational constraints, inevitably leading to a loss in precision. Additionally, high-dimensional features extracted using different feature extractors from various modalities require specific techniques to mitigate cross-modal differences for effective matching. To address these challenges, we propose a method that uses edge information from the original point clouds and images for cross-modal registration. We retain crucial information from the original data by extracting edge points and pixels, enhancing registration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The use of edge points and edge pixels allows us to introduce an attention-based feature exchange block to eliminate cross-modal disparities. Furthermore, we incorporate an optimal matching layer to improve correspondence identification. We validate the accuracy of our method on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

Chronic wounds are difficult and costly to treat, and have become a serious burden on health care systems worldwide. Chronic wounds can have devastating consequences for the patient, with infection often leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. Innovative deep learning methods for the detection and monitoring of such wounds have the potential to reduce the impact to both patient and clinician. We present a novel multimodal segmentation method which allows for the introduction of patient metadata into the training workflow whereby the patient data are expressed as Gaussian random fields. Our results indicate that the proposed method improved performance when utilising multiple models, each trained on different metadata categories. Using the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 test set, when compared to the baseline results (intersection over union = 0.4670, Dice similarity coefficient = 0.5908) we demonstrate improvements of +0.0220 and +0.0229 for intersection over union and Dice similarity coefficient respectively. This paper presents the first study to focus on integrating patient data into a chronic wound segmentation workflow. Our results show significant performance gains when training individual models using specific metadata categories, followed by average merging of prediction masks using distance transforms.

In this paper, we introduce JMMMU (Japanese MMMU), the first large-scale Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on expert-level tasks based on the Japanese cultural context. To facilitate comprehensive culture-aware evaluation, JMMMU features two complementary subsets: (i) culture-agnostic (CA) subset, where the culture-independent subjects (e.g., Math) are selected and translated into Japanese, enabling one-to-one comparison with its English counterpart MMMU; and (ii) culture-specific (CS) subset, comprising newly crafted subjects that reflect Japanese cultural context. Using the CA subset, we observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which is purely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal their inadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets, we identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CS subset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacks depth in cultural understanding. We hope this work will not only help advance LMM performance in Japanese but also serve as a guideline to create high-standard, culturally diverse benchmarks for multilingual LMM development.

By leveraging contrastive learning across diverse modalities, large-scale multimodal data enhances representational quality. However, a critical yet often overlooked challenge remains: multimodal data is rarely collected in a single process, and training from scratch is computationally expensive. Instead, emergent multimodal data can be used to optimize existing models gradually, \textit{i.e.}, models are trained on a sequence of modality pair data. We define this problem as Continual Multimodal Contrastive Learning (CMCL), an underexplored yet crucial research direction at the intersection of multimodal and continual learning. In this paper, we formulate CMCL through two specialized principles of stability and plasticity. We theoretically derive a novel optimization-based method, which projects updated gradients from dual sides onto subspaces where any gradient is prevented from interfering with the previously learned knowledge. Two upper bounds provide theoretical insights on both stability and plasticity in our solution. Beyond our theoretical contributions, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets by comparing our method against advanced continual learning baselines. The empirical results further support our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation methods face limitations due to the significant human workload required to design Q&A pairs for visual images, which inherently restricts the scale and scope of evaluations. Although automated MLLM-as-judge approaches attempt to reduce the human workload through automatic evaluations, they often introduce biases. To address these problems, we propose an Unsupervised Peer review MLLM Evaluation framework. It utilizes only image data, allowing models to automatically generate questions and conduct peer review assessments of answers from other models, effectively alleviating the reliance on human workload. Additionally, we introduce the vision-language scoring system to mitigate the bias issues, which focuses on three aspects: (i) response correctness; (ii) visual understanding and reasoning; and (iii) image-text correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that UPME achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.944 with human evaluations on the MMstar dataset and 0.814 on the ScienceQA dataset, indicating that our framework closely aligns with human-designed benchmarks and inherent human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks. (ii) Multimodal mathematical models and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) models did not exhibit significant improvements in number sense abilities. (iii) Stronger MLLMs with larger parameter sizes and broader general abilities demonstrate modest gains in number sense abilities. We believe VisNumBench will serve as a valuable resource for the research community, encouraging further advancements in enhancing MLLMs' number sense abilities.

This study introduces an innovative deep learning-based model leveraging multimodal data-2D RGB images from different views, depth images, and 3D point clouds-for the non-invasive estimation of duck body dimensions and weight. A dataset of 1,023 Linwu ducks, comprising over 5,000 samples with diverse postures and conditions, was collected to support model training. The proposed method innovatively employs PointNet++ to extract key feature points from point clouds, extracts and computes corresponding 3D geometric features, and fuses them with multi-view convolutional 2D features. A Transformer encoder is then utilized to capture long-range dependencies and refine feature interactions, thereby enhancing prediction robustness. The model achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.33% and an R2 of 0.953 across eight morphometric parameters, demonstrating strong predictive capability. Unlike conventional manual measurements, the proposed model enables high-precision estimation while eliminating the necessity for physical handling, thereby reducing animal stress and broadening its application scope. This study marks the first application of deep learning techniques to poultry body dimension and weight estimation, providing a valuable reference for the intelligent and precise management of the livestock industry with far-reaching practical significance.</p></details> |  |

Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a flexible network architecture that effectively fuses multimodal information, accommodating an arbitrary number of input modalities without requiring significant modifications to the diffusion process. Crucially, we mitigate hallucinations, often introduced by text prompts, by using spatial information from other modalities to guide regional text-based conditioning. Each modality's guidance strength can also be controlled independently, allowing steering outputs toward different directions, such as increasing bokeh through depth or adjusting object prominence via segmentation.

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond.

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.13080v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |
