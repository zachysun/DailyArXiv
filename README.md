| **[Online model learning with data-assimilated reservoir computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16767v1)** | 2025-04-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16767v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation.We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Time Series Dataset of NIR Spectra and RGB and NIR-HSI Images of the Barley Germination Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16658v1)** | 2025-04-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16658v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide an open-source dataset of RGB and NIR-HSI (near-infrared hyperspectral imaging) images with associated segmentation masks and NIR spectra of 2242 individual malting barley kernels. We imaged every kernel pre-exposure to moisture and every 24 hours after exposure to moisture for five consecutive days. Every barley kernel was labeled as germinated or not germinated during each image acquisition. The barley kernels were imaged with black filter paper as the background, facilitating straight-forward intensity threshold-based segmentation, e.g., by Otsu's method. This dataset facilitates time series analysis of germination time for barley kernels using either RGB image analysis, NIR spectral analysis, NIR-HSI analysis, or a combination hereof.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24104v2)** | 2025-04-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.24104v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |

The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.

| **[iTFKAN: Interpretable Time Series Forecasting with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16432v1)** | 2025-04-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16432v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As time evolves, data within specific domains exhibit predictability that motivates time series forecasting to predict future trends from historical data. However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising performance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and practical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies, prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting performance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Adaptive Student's t-distribution with method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03069v4)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2304.03069v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real life time series are usually nonstationary, bringing a difficult question of model adaptation. Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Adaptive PCA-Based Outlier Detection for Multi-Feature Time Series in Space Missions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15846v1)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.15846v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing multi-featured time series data is critical for space missions making efficient event detection, potentially onboard, essential for automatic analysis. However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink constraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in real time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on the reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm adapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA, enabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A pre-scaling process normalizes each feature's magnitude while preserving relative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space environments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers through NASA's MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to NASA's THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using onboard-available measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCS 2025</p></details> |

At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TrustBus@ARES</p></details> |
| **[Transfer Learning for High-dimensional Reduced Rank Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15691v1)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.15691v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of transfer learning is to enhance estimation and inference in a target data by leveraging knowledge gained from additional sources. Recent studies have explored transfer learning for independent observations in complex, high-dimensional models assuming sparsity, yet research on time series models remains limited. Our focus is on transfer learning for sequences of observations with temporal dependencies and a more intricate model parameter structure. Specifically, we investigate the vector autoregressive model (VAR), a widely recognized model for time series data, where the transition matrix can be deconstructed into a combination of a sparse matrix and a low-rank one. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm tailored for estimating high-dimensional VAR models characterized by low-rank and sparse structures. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting informative observations from auxiliary datasets. Theoretical guarantees are established, encompassing model parameter consistency, informative set selection, and the asymptotic distribution of estimators under mild conditions. The latter facilitates the construction of entry-wise confidence intervals for model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical efficacy of our methodologies through both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages accepted by AISTATS2025</p></details> |
| **[Causal-Copilot: An Autonomous Causal Analysis Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13263v2)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13263v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal analysis plays a foundational role in scientific discovery and reliable decision-making, yet it remains largely inaccessible to domain experts due to its conceptual and algorithmic complexity. This disconnect between causal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain experts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods. To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model framework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for both tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal inference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art causal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding access to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich, real-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world applicability in causal analysis. A live interactive demo of Causal-Copilot is available at https://causalcopilot.com/.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^2$AD: Multi-Sensor Multi-System Anomaly Detection through Global Scoring and Calibrated Thresholding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15225v1)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.15225v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread availability of sensor data across industrial and operational systems, we frequently encounter heterogeneous time series from multiple systems. Anomaly detection is crucial for such systems to facilitate predictive maintenance. However, most existing anomaly detection methods are designed for either univariate or single-system multivariate data, making them insufficient for these complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce M$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models to capture expected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators of potential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly score through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically demonstrate that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and dependencies across sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms existing methods in extensive evaluations by 21% on average, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale real-world case study on 130 assets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers.

| **[A Deep Learning Framework for Sequence Mining with Bidirectional LSTM and Multi-Scale Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15223v1)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.15223v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of mining latent patterns and modeling contextual dependencies in complex sequence data. A sequence pattern mining algorithm is proposed by integrating Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a multi-scale attention mechanism. The BiLSTM captures both forward and backward dependencies in sequences, enhancing the model's ability to perceive global contextual structures. At the same time, the multi-scale attention module assigns adaptive weights to key feature regions under different window sizes. This improves the model's responsiveness to both local and global important information. Extensive experiments are conducted on a publicly available multivariate time series dataset. The proposed model is compared with several mainstream sequence modeling methods. Results show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. This confirms the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed architecture in complex pattern recognition tasks. Further ablation studies and sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the effects of attention scale and input sequence length on model performance. These results provide empirical support for structural optimization of the model.</p></details> |  |

However, the mobility demand for our devices naturally imposes constraints on their computational and communication capabilities. A solution is to locally learn knowledge from data captured by ubiquitous devices, rather than to store and transmit the data in its original form. In this paper, we develop a federated learning framework, called Centaur, to incorporate on-device data selection at the edge, which allows partition-based training of a deep neural nets through collaboration between constrained and resourceful devices within the multidevice ecosystem of the same user. We benchmark on five neural net architecture and six datasets that include image data and wearable sensor time series. On average, Centaur achieves ~19% higher classification accuracy and ~58% lower federated training latency, compared to the baseline. We also evaluate Centaur when dealing with imbalanced non-iid data, client participation heterogeneity, and different mobility patterns. To encourage further research in this area, we release our code at https://github.com/nokia-bell-labs/data-centric-federated-learning</p></details> | <details><summary>An ea...</summary><p>An early version (v3) has been presented at ICLR 2023 Workshop on Machine Learning for IoT: Datasets, Perception, and Understanding</p></details> |
| **[Learning Compositional Transferability of Time Series for Source-Free Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14994v1)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.14994v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation is challenging for time series classification due to the highly dynamic nature. This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both target labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain adaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data, time series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source time series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply fine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose the learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal patterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to disentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional architecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a U-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the initial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step to prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer adaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a residual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation branch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's output. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their composition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is disentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is retained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the training, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay branch to tolerate instance-wise variation. The experimental results show that such compositional architecture of time series reconstruction leads to SOTA performance on 3 widely used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author: Su Yang</p></details> |
| **[Multiple-Resolution Tokenization for Time Series Forecasting with an Application to Pricing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03185v2)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.03185v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a transformer architecture for time series forecasting with a focus on time series tokenisation and apply it to a real-world prediction problem from the pricing domain. Our architecture aims to learn effective representations at many scales across all available data simultaneously. The model contains a number of novel modules: a differentiated form of time series patching which employs multiple resolutions, a multiple-resolution module for time-varying known variables, a mixer-based module for capturing cross-series information, and a novel output head with favourable scaling to account for the increased number of tokens. We present an application of this model to a real world prediction problem faced by the markdown team at a very large retailer. On the experiments conducted our model outperforms in-house models and the selected existing deep learning architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structuring Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs with Particle Swarm Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05347v2)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.05347v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing (RC) is a time-efficient computational paradigm derived from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The Simple Cycle Reservoir (SCR) is an RC model that stands out for its minimalistic design, offering extremely low construction complexity and proven capability of universally approximating time-invariant causal fading memory filters, even in the linear dynamics regime. This paper introduces Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs (MSCRs), a multi-reservoir framework that extends Echo State Networks (ESNs) by replacing a single large reservoir with multiple interconnected SCRs. We demonstrate that optimizing MSCR using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperforms existing multi-reservoir models, achieving competitive predictive performance with a lower-dimensional state space. By modeling interconnections as a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), our approach enables flexible, task-specific network topology adaptation. Numerical simulations on three benchmark time-series prediction tasks confirm these advantages over rival algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of MSCR-PSO as a promising framework for optimizing multi-reservoir systems, providing a foundation for further advancements and applications of interconnected SCRs for developing efficient AI devices.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC 2025)</p></details> |

We present the first comprehensive study investigating these models' temporal plasticity - their ability to progressively enhance performance through continual learning while maintaining existing capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets exhibiting distribution shifts, we evaluate both conventional deep learning models and foundation models using a novel continual learning framework. Our findings reveal that while traditional models struggle with performance deterioration during incremental fine-tuning, foundation models like Time-MoE and Chronos demonstrate sustained improvement in predictive accuracy. This suggests that optimizing foundation model fine-tuning strategies may be more valuable than developing domain-specific small models. Our research introduces new evaluation methodologies and insights for developing foundation time series models with robust continuous learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pets: General Pattern Assisted Architecture For Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14209v1)** | 2025-04-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.14209v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis has found widespread applications in areas such as weather forecasting, anomaly detection, and healthcare. However, real-world sequential data often exhibit a superimposed state of various fluctuation patterns, including hourly, daily, and monthly frequencies. Traditional decomposition techniques struggle to effectively disentangle these multiple fluctuation patterns from the seasonal components, making time series analysis challenging. Surpassing the existing multi-period decoupling paradigms, this paper introduces a novel perspective based on energy distribution within the temporal-spectrum space. By adaptively quantifying observed sequences into continuous frequency band intervals, the proposed approach reconstructs fluctuation patterns across diverse periods without relying on domain-specific prior knowledge. Building upon this innovative strategy, we propose Pets, an enhanced architecture that is adaptable to arbitrary model structures. Pets integrates a Fluctuation Pattern Assisted (FPA) module and a Context-Guided Mixture of Predictors (MoP). The FPA module facilitates information fusion among diverse fluctuation patterns by capturing their dependencies and progressively modeling these patterns as latent representations at each layer. Meanwhile, the MoP module leverages these compound pattern representations to guide and regulate the reconstruction of distinct fluctuations hierarchically. Pets achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposition-based multi-scale transformer framework for time series anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14206v1)** | 2025-04-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.14206v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is crucial for maintaining stable systems. Existing methods face two main challenges. First, it is difficult to directly model the dependencies of diverse and complex patterns within the sequences. Second, many methods that optimize parameters using mean squared error struggle with noise in the time series, leading to performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based framework built on decomposition (TransDe) for multivariate time series anomaly detection. The key idea is to combine the strengths of time series decomposition and transformers to effectively learn the complex patterns in normal time series data. A multi-scale patch-based transformer architecture is proposed to exploit the representative dependencies of each decomposed component of the time series. Furthermore, a contrastive learn paradigm based on patch operation is proposed, which leverages KL divergence to align the positive pairs, namely the pure representations of normal patterns between different patch-level views. A novel asynchronous loss function with a stop-gradient strategy is further introduced to enhance the performance of TransDe effectively. It can avoid time-consuming and labor-intensive computation costs in the optimization process. Extensive experiments on five public datasets are conducted and TransDe shows superiority compared with twelve baselines in terms of F1 score. Our code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/TransDe.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.</p></details> |  |

While Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been individually applied in optimization and deep learning, their combined use for enhancing convergence in numerical optimization tasks remains underexplored. Our work addresses this gap by integrating LLMs into PSO to reduce model evaluations and improve convergence for deep learning hyperparameter tuning. The proposed LLM-enhanced PSO method addresses the difficulties of efficiency and convergence by using LLMs (particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and Llama3) to improve PSO performance, allowing for faster achievement of target objectives. Our method speeds up search space exploration by substituting underperforming particle placements with best suggestions offered by LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across three scenarios -- (1) optimizing the Rastrigin function, (2) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series regression, and (3) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for material classification -- show that the method significantly improves convergence rates and lowers computational costs. Depending on the application, computational complexity is lowered by 20% to 60% compared to traditional PSO methods.

Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements. In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, currently under review at Eusipco 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, the original na\"ive forecast is adjusted by a weighted movement prediction term, where the weights are determined via two parameters derived from the in-sample data: one based on directional accuracy of the movement prediction and the other on the mean absolute increment of the target series. Simulation experiments were conducted across four types of synthetic symmetric random walk series, each with different variance structures. For each time series, diverse movement predictions with predefined directional accuracies were randomly generated, and the resulting forecasts were evaluated via the RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE metrics. The results demonstrated a clear monotonic improvement in the forecast performance as the directional accuracy increased. Notably, the adjusted na\"ive forecast achieved statistically significant improvements even at relatively low directional accuracy levels slightly above 0.50. These findings imply that the movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast can serve as an effective second-stage method for forecasting symmetric random walk time series when consistent and accurate movement predictions are provided.</p></details> |  |

However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025. 26 pages, 19 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges such as high memory requirements and computational costs with limited interpretability. This paper introduces an approach where master equations of physics are converted into multilayered networks that are trained via backpropagation. The resulting general-purpose model effectively encodes data in the properties of the underlying physical system. In contrast to existing methods wherein a trained neural network is used as a computationally efficient alternative for solving physical equations, our approach directly treats physics equations as trainable models. We demonstrate this physical embedding concept with the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE), which acts as trainable architecture for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. The network embeds data representation in orders of magnitude fewer parameters than conventional neural networks when tested on time series data. Notably, the trained "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network" is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings. This interpretability offers insight into the underlying dynamics of the system that produced the data. The proposed method of replacing traditional DNN feature learning architectures with physical equations is also extended to the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework to other master equations of physics. Among our results, an ablation study quantifies the relative importance of physical terms such as dispersion, nonlinearity, and potential energy for classification accuracy. We also outline the limitations of this approach as it relates to generalizability.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that the Riemannian geometry induced from weighted Hardy norms for the smooth transformations of its transfer function is a K\"ahler manifold. In this setting, the K\"ahler potential of the linear system geometry corresponds to the squared weighted Hardy norm of the composite transfer function. With the inherent structure of K\"ahler manifolds, geometric quantities on the manifold of linear systems in weighted Hardy spaces can be computed more efficiently and elegantly. Moreover, this generalized framework unifies a variety of well-known information manifolds within the structure of K\"ahler information manifolds for signal filters. Several illustrative examples from time series models are provided, wherein the metric tensor, Levi-Civita connection, and K\"ahler potentials are explicitly expressed in terms of polylogarithmic functions of the poles and zeros of transfer functions parameterized by weight vectors.</p></details> | 23 pages |

We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants performing various ARAT items.

In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

By using an internal neural network with random, fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture. Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while deepening our understanding of neural computation.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the demand for multimodal machine learning models has sharply risen for modalities that go beyond vision and language, such as sequences, graphs, time series, or tabular data. While there are many available multimodal fusion and alignment approaches, most of them require end-to-end training, scale quadratically with the number of modalities, cannot handle cases of high modality imbalance in the training set, or are highly topology-specific, making them too restrictive for many biomedical learning tasks. This paper presents Multimodal Lego (MM-Lego), a general-purpose fusion framework to turn any set of encoders into a competitive multimodal model with no or minimal fine-tuning. We achieve this by introducing a wrapper for any unimodal encoder that enforces shape consistency between modality representations. It harmonises these representations by learning features in the frequency domain to enable model merging with little signal interference. We show that MM-Lego 1) can be used as a model merging method which achieves competitive performance with end-to-end fusion models without any fine-tuning, 2) can operate on any unimodal encoder, and 3) is a model fusion method that, with minimal fine-tuning, surpasses all benchmarks in five out of seven datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) faces two major challenges: catastrophic forgetting and intra-class variations. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because gradient-based parameter update strategies inevitably erase past knowledge. And unlike images, time series data exhibits subject-specific patterns, also known as intra-class variations, which refer to differences in patterns observed within the same class. While exemplar-based methods fail to cover diverse variation with limited samples, existing exemplar-free methods lack explicit mechanisms to handle intra-class variations. To address these two challenges, we propose TS-ACL, which leverages a gradient-free closed-form solution to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem inherent in gradient-based optimization methods while simultaneously learning global distributions to resolve intra-class variations. Additionally, it provides privacy protection and efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets covering various sensor modalities and tasks demonstrate that TS-ACL achieves performance close to joint training on four datasets, outperforming existing methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for TSCIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In time-series classification tasks, the number of features obtained using a reservoir depends on the length of the input series. Therefore, the features must be converted to a constant-length intermediate representation (IR), such that they can be processed by an output layer. Existing conversion methods involve computationally expensive matrix inversion that significantly increases the circuit size and requires processing power when implemented in hardware. In this article, we propose a simple but effective IR, namely, dot-product-based reservoir representation (DPRR), for RC based on the dot product of data features. Additionally, we propose a hardware-friendly delayed-feedback reservoir (DFR) consisting of a nonlinear element and delayed feedback loop with DPRR. The proposed DFR successfully classified multivariate time series data that has been considered particularly difficult to implement efficiently in hardware. In contrast to conventional DFR models that require analog circuits, the proposed model can be implemented in a fully digital manner suitable for high-level syntheses. A comparison with existing machine-learning methods via field-programmable gate array implementation using 12 multivariate time-series classification tasks confirmed the superior accuracy and small circuit size of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches use Transformer architectures to model long-range dependencies via positional encoding. However, they lack accuracy in recognizing fine-grained, short-range temporal dependencies between gestures captured at high frame rates. Moreover, their high computational complexity leads to inefficient training. To mitigate these issues, we propose an Adaptive Transformer (ADAT), which incorporates components for enhanced feature extraction and adaptive feature weighting through a gating mechanism to emphasize contextually relevant features while reducing training overhead and maintaining translation accuracy. To evaluate ADAT, we introduce MedASL, the first public medical American Sign Language dataset. In sign-to-gloss-to-text experiments, ADAT outperforms the encoder-decoder transformer, improving BLEU-4 accuracy by 0.1% while reducing training time by 14.33% on PHOENIX14T and 3.24% on MedASL. In sign-to-text experiments, it improves accuracy by 8.7% and reduces training time by 2.8% on PHOENIX14T and achieves 4.7% higher accuracy and 7.17% faster training on MedASL. Compared to encoder-only and decoder-only baselines in sign-to-text, ADAT is at least 6.8% more accurate despite being up to 12.1% slower due to its dual-stream structure.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.

However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

The purpose of time-series anomaly detection is to reduce potential damages or losses. However, existing anomaly detection models detect anomalies through the error between the model output and the ground truth (observed) value, which makes them impractical. In this work, we present a \textit{proactive} approach for time-series anomaly detection based on a time-series forecasting model specialized for anomaly detection and a data-driven anomaly detection model. Our proactive approach establishes an anomaly threshold from training data with a data-driven anomaly detection model, and anomalies are subsequently detected by identifying predicted values that exceed the anomaly threshold. In addition, we extensively evaluated the model using four anomaly detection benchmarks and analyzed both predictable and unpredictable anomalies. We attached the source code as supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 I Can't Believe It's Not Better: Challenges in Applied Deep Learning Workshop (ICBINB)</p></details> |

However, structured electronic health records capture few data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations (n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access (PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93). We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA corpus for temporal analytics.</p></details> |  |

In this research, we explore the application of Double DQN (DDQN) and Dueling Network Architectures, to financial trading tasks using historical SP500 index data. Our focus is training agents capable of optimizing trading strategies while accounting for practical constraints such as transaction costs. The study evaluates the model performance across scenarios with and without commissions, highlighting the impact of cost-sensitive environments on reward dynamics. Despite computational limitations and the inherent complexity of financial time series data, the agent successfully learned meaningful trading policies. The findings confirm that RL agents, even when trained on limited datasets, can outperform random strategies by leveraging advanced architectures such as DDQN and Dueling Networks. However, significant challenges persist, particularly with a sub-optimal policy due to the complexity of data source.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce TADACap, a retrieval-based framework to generate domain-aware captions for time-series images, capable of adapting to new domains without retraining. Building on TADACap, we propose a novel retrieval strategy that retrieves diverse image-caption pairs from a target domain database, namely TADACap-diverse. We benchmarked TADACap-diverse against state-of-the-art methods and ablation variants. TADACap-diverse demonstrates comparable semantic accuracy while requiring significantly less annotation effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICAIF 2024</p></details> |

The model first applies STL and FFT to extract trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.</p></details> |  |

Using AI systems, some tasks within these domains can be efficiently handled. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to increase the reliability of AI solutions by explaining model reasoning. For time series, many XAI methods provide point- or sequence-based attribution maps. These methods explain model reasoning in terms of low-level patterns. However, they do not capture high-level patterns that may also influence model reasoning. We propose a concept-based method to provide explanations in terms of these high-level patterns. In this paper, we present C-SHAP for time series, an approach which determines the contribution of concepts to a model outcome. We provide a general definition of C-SHAP and present an example implementation using time series decomposition. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology through a use case from the energy domain.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Many of these approaches rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series such as instruments, negative controls or time series that satisfy the front- or backdoor criterion in certain graphs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating direct (and via Wright's path rule total) causal effects in a time series setup which does not rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series. This approach assumes that the underlying time series is a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) process and estimates direct causal effects by solving certain linear equation systems made up of different covariances and model parameters. We state sufficient graphical criteria in terms of the so-called full time graph under which these linear equations systems are uniquely solvable and under which their solutions contain the to-be-identified direct causal effects as components. We also state sufficient lag-based criteria under which the previously mentioned graphical conditions are satisfied and, thus, under which direct causal effects are identifiable. Several numerical experiments underline the correctness and applicability of our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages main paper, 25 pages Appendix, 50 pages in total, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Their idea is to solve an ODE with Neural Network-defined dynamics, which take the immediate parameters of the observed system into account. However, larger integration intervals cause instability, which forces most modern methods to normalize time to $[0, 1]$. We provably stabilize these models by introducing an adaptive negative feedback mechanism. This modification allows for longer integration, which in turn implies higher expressiveness, mirroring the behaviour of increasing depth in conventional Neural Networks.Additionally, it provides intriguing theoretical properties: forgetfulness and missing-value robustness. For three open datasets, our method obtains up to 20\% improvements in downstream quality if compared to existing baselines, including State Space Models and Neural~CDEs.</p></details> |  |

Algorithms aiming at transferring knowledge from data-rich to data-scarce tasks have thus surged in popularity. However, despite their effectiveness in previous evaluations, their performance in challenging real-world applications is unclear and needs to be evaluated. This study benchmarks transfer learning and several meta-learning algorithms, including (First-Order) Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ((FO)-MAML), Almost No Inner Loop (ANIL), and Task-Informed Meta-Learning (TIML), on the real-world EuroCropsML time series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to simpler transfer learning methods when applied to crop type classification tasks in Estonia after pre-training on data from Latvia. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, we find that the transfer of knowledge between geographically disparate regions, such as Estonia and Portugal, poses significant challenges to all investigated algorithms. These insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resource requirements in selecting machine learning methods for real-world crop type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of transferring knowledge between different regions of the Earth. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating transfer and meta-learning methods for crop type classification under real-world conditions.

While Transformer-based methods excel in capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from high computational complexities and tend to overfit. Conversely, MLP-based methods offer computational efficiency and adeptness in modeling temporal dynamics, but they struggle with capturing complex temporal patterns effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MLP-based Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition (AMD) framework for TSF. Our framework decomposes time series into distinct temporal patterns at multiple scales, leveraging the Multi-Scale Decomposable Mixing (MDM) block to dissect and aggregate these patterns in a residual manner. Complemented by the Dual Dependency Interaction (DDI) block and the Adaptive Multi-predictor Synthesis (AMS) block, our approach effectively models both temporal and channel dependencies and utilizes autocorrelation to refine multi-scale data integration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our AMD framework not only overcomes the limitations of existing methods but also consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks across various datasets, showcasing superior efficiency.

However, pretraining on such datasets introduces significant challenges due to substantial mismatches in data distributions, a problem particularly pronounced with time series data. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a domain-aware adaptive normalization strategy within the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we replace the traditional LayerNorm with a prototype-guided dynamic normalization mechanism (ProtoNorm), where learned prototypes encapsulate distinct data distributions, and sample-to-prototype affinity determines the appropriate normalization layer. This mechanism effectively captures the heterogeneity of time series characteristics, aligning pretrained representations with downstream tasks. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional pretraining techniques across both classification and forecasting tasks, while effectively mitigating the adverse effects of distribution shifts during pretraining. Incorporating ProtoNorm is as simple as replacing a single line of code. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world time series benchmarks validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach, advancing the development of more versatile time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important.

Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, conditionally accepted to ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are indispensable in diagnosing various heart conditions; however, their manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose xLSTM-ECG, a novel approach that leverages an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network for multi-label classification of ECG signals, using the PTB-XL dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first design and application of xLSTM modules specifically adapted for multi-label ECG classification. Our method employs a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert time-series ECG waveforms into the frequency domain, thereby enhancing feature extraction. The xLSTM architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities of 12-lead ECG recordings by capturing both local and global signal features. Comprehensive experiments on the PTB-XL dataset reveal that our model achieves strong multi-label classification performance, while additional tests on the Georgia 12-Lead dataset underscore its robustness and efficiency. This approach significantly improves ECG classification accuracy, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics and patient care. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 tables, 18 figures</p></details> |

The challenge of this task lies in measuring the influences of different news events towards the fluctuations of time series. This requires agents to possess stronger abilities of innovative thinking and the identifying misleading logic. However, the existing multi-agent discussion framework has limited enhancement on time series prediction in terms of optimizing these two capabilities. Inspired by the role of competition in fostering innovation, this study embeds a competition mechanism within the multi-agent discussion to enhance agents' capability of generating innovative thoughts. Furthermore, to bolster the model's proficiency in identifying misleading information, we incorporate a fine-tuned small-scale LLM model within the reflective stage, offering auxiliary decision-making support. Experimental results confirm that the competition can boost agents' capacity for innovative thinking, which can significantly improve the performances of time series prediction. Similar to the findings of social science, the intensity of competition within this framework can influence the performances of agents, providing a new perspective for studying LLMs-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Especially, the intricate coupling between internal uncertainties and external disturbances further exacerbates this challenge. This study introduces an effective and convergent algorithm enabling accurate estimation of the coupled disturbance via combining control and learning philosophies. Concretely, by resorting to Chebyshev series expansion, the coupled disturbance is firstly decomposed into an unknown parameter matrix and two known structures dependent on system state and external disturbance respectively. A regularized least squares algorithm is subsequently formalized to learn the parameter matrix using historical time-series data. Finally, a polynomial disturbance observer is specifically devised to achieve a high-precision estimation of the coupled disturbance by utilizing the learned portion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations and real flight tests. We believe this work can offer a new pathway to integrate learning approaches into control frameworks for addressing longstanding challenges in robotic applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Existing benchmarks and leaderboards are predominantly English-centric, with only a few addressing other languages. These benchmarks fall short in several key areas: they overlook the diversity of language varieties, prioritize fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities over tasks of industrial relevance, and are static. With these aspects in mind, we present IberBench, a comprehensive and extensible benchmark designed to assess LLM performance on both fundamental and industry-relevant NLP tasks, in languages spoken across the Iberian Peninsula and Ibero-America. IberBench integrates 101 datasets from evaluation campaigns and recent benchmarks, covering 22 task categories such as sentiment and emotion analysis, toxicity detection, and summarization. The benchmark addresses key limitations in current evaluation practices, such as the lack of linguistic diversity and static evaluation setups by enabling continual updates and community-driven model and dataset submissions moderated by a committee of experts. We evaluate 23 LLMs ranging from 100 million to 14 billion parameters and provide empirical insights into their strengths and limitations. Our findings indicate that (i) LLMs perform worse on industry-relevant tasks than in fundamental ones, (ii) performance is on average lower for Galician and Basque, (iii) some tasks show results close to random, and (iv) in other tasks LLMs perform above random but below shared task systems. IberBench offers open-source implementations for the entire evaluation pipeline, including dataset normalization and hosting, incremental evaluation of LLMs, and a publicly accessible leaderboard.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textbf{OptimAI}, a framework for solving \underline{Optim}ization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered \underline{AI} agents, achieving superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is built upon four key roles: (1) a \emph{formulator} that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a \emph{planner} that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a \emph{coder} and a \emph{code critic} capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions. Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain. Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, allowing us to conveniently explore the synergistic effect of combining diverse models within a unified system. Our approach attains 88.1\% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 71.2\% on the Optibench (non-linear w/o table) subset, reducing error rates by 58\% and 50\% respectively over prior best results.</p></details> |  |

The key innovation of our method lies in the use of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which enables the model to generate explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that COT Fine-tuned achieves high accuracy in both tasks, with strong performance in LLM identification and human-AI classification. We also show that the CoT reasoning process contributes significantly to the models effectiveness and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>De-Fa...</summary><p>De-Factify 4: 4th Workshop on Multimodal Fact Checking and Hate Speech Detection, co-located with AAAI 2025.

To address this challenge, we present aiXamine, a comprehensive black-box evaluation platform for LLM safety and security. aiXamine integrates over 40 tests (i.e., benchmarks) organized into eight key services targeting specific dimensions of safety and security: adversarial robustness, code security, fairness and bias, hallucination, model and data privacy, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, over-refusal, and safety alignment. The platform aggregates the evaluation results into a single detailed report per model, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance, test examples, and rich visualizations. We used aiXamine to assess over 50 publicly available and proprietary LLMs, conducting over 2K examinations. Our findings reveal notable vulnerabilities in leading models, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks in OpenAI's GPT-4o, biased outputs in xAI's Grok-3, and privacy weaknesses in Google's Gemini 2.0. Additionally, we observe that open-source models can match or exceed proprietary models in specific services such as safety alignment, fairness and bias, and OOD robustness. Finally, we identify trade-offs between distillation strategies, model size, training methods, and architectural choices.</p></details> |  |

Our experiments probe the domain sensitivity of LLMs by examining their ability to distinguish queries from different domains using hidden states generated during the prefill phase. We reveal latent domain-related trajectories that indicate the model's internal recognition of query domains. We also study the robustness of these domain representations to variations in prompt styles and sources. Our approach leverages these representations for model selection, mapping the LLM that best matches the domain trace of the input query (i.e., the model with the highest performance on similar traces). Our findings show that LLMs can differentiate queries for related domains, and that the fine-tuned model is not always the most accurate. Unlike previous work, our interpretations apply to both closed and open-ended generative tasks</p></details> |  |

This has driven the development of "copyright takedown" methods, post-training approaches aimed at preventing models from generating content substantially similar to copyrighted ones. While current mitigation approaches are somewhat effective for average-case risks, we demonstrate that they overlook worst-case copyright risks exhibits by the existence of long, verbatim quotes from copyrighted sources. We propose BloomScrub, a remarkably simple yet highly effective inference-time approach that provides certified copyright takedown. Our method repeatedly interleaves quote detection with rewriting techniques to transform potentially infringing segments. By leveraging efficient data sketches (Bloom filters), our approach enables scalable copyright screening even for large-scale real-world corpora. When quotes beyond a length threshold cannot be removed, the system can abstain from responding, offering certified risk reduction. Experimental results show that BloomScrub reduces infringement risk, preserves utility, and accommodates different levels of enforcement stringency with adaptive abstention. Our results suggest that lightweight, inference-time methods can be surprisingly effective for copyright prevention.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 34th ACM SIGSOFT ISSTA Companion (LLMSC Workshop 2025)</p></details> |

Web APIs that employ the REST style are known as RESTful (or REST) APIs. When using or testing a RESTful API, developers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by open-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). However, it can be very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these specifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially when the software requirements change. Many tools and methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. OAS generation can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a formal description of API endpoints derived from the source code. A potential solution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have strong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs using LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to generate OASs for RESTful APIs. Compared with existing tools and methods, LRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with partial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.). To evaluate the LRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20 real-world RESTful APIs. The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and DeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and LRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed entities than the developer-provided specifications.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches critically depend on external supervision--such as human-labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form natural reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, \ours boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves the accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Base from 32.1\% to 50.1\% on MMLU-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

It plays a crucial role in shaping our identity, making decisions, learning from past experiences, building relationships, and adapting to changes. In the era of large language models (LLMs), memory refers to the ability of an AI system to retain, recall, and use information from past interactions to improve future responses and interactions. Although previous research and reviews have provided detailed descriptions of memory mechanisms, there is still a lack of a systematic review that summarizes and analyzes the relationship between the memory of LLM-driven AI systems and human memory, as well as how we can be inspired by human memory to construct more powerful memory systems. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory of LLM-driven AI systems. In particular, we first conduct a detailed analysis of the categories of human memory and relate them to the memory of AI systems. Second, we systematically organize existing memory-related work and propose a categorization method based on three dimensions (object, form, and time) and eight quadrants. Finally, we illustrate some open problems regarding the memory of current AI systems and outline possible future directions for memory in the era of large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

Creating high-quality AI system requirements is crucial for aligning the AI system with business goals and consumer values and for social responsibility. However, with the uncertain nature of AI systems and the heavy reliance on sensitive data, more research is needed to address the elicitation and analysis of AI systems requirements. With the proprietary nature of many AI systems, there is a lack of open-source requirements artifacts and technical requirements documents for AI systems, limiting broader research and investigation. With Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as a promising alternative to human-generated text, this paper investigates the potential use of LLMs to generate user stories for AI systems based on abstracts from scholarly papers. We conducted an empirical evaluation using three LLMs and generated $1260$ user stories from $42$ abstracts from $26$ domains. We assess their quality using the Quality User Story (QUS) framework. Moreover, we identify relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) and ethical principles. Our analysis demonstrates that the investigated LLMs can generate user stories inspired by the needs of various stakeholders, offering a promising approach for generating user stories for research purposes and for aiding in the early requirements elicitation phase of AI systems. We have compiled and curated a collection of stories generated by various LLMs into a dataset (UStAI), which is now publicly available for use.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework that emphasizes efficient and cooperative deployment. The proposed method restructures the GDM inference process by allowing users with semantically similar prompts to share parts of the denoising chain. Furthermore, to maximize the users' subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach, i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI), which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to replicate user interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback aligned with diverse user personalities. Lastly, we present the GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDDPG) algorithm, adapted to the proposed RLLI framework, to allocate communication and computing resources effectively while accounting for subjective user traits and dynamic wireless conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that G-DDPG improves total QoE by 15% compared with the standard DDPG algorithm.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agent frameworks still face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting their effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning methods often lack clear global goals, leading agents to get stuck in local branches, or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution mechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited action space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To address these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that introduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a hierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into high-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby reducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across diverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark with multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of tools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate. These findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more advanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex real-world applications.

Existing studies often optimize these metrics separately, typically by first applying quality filtering and then adjusting data proportions. However, these approaches overlook the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity, necessitating their joint consideration. Given a fixed training quota, it is essential to evaluate both the quality of each data point and its complementary effect on the overall dataset. In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection framework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution for LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically, we first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain classification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity. QuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that determines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality and diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal parameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments on smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the RegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across multiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for quality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an AI-powered depression prevention system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze real-time conversational cues--including subtle emotional expressions (e.g., micro-sentiment shifts, self-referential language patterns)--for more accurate and dynamic mental state assessment. Our system achieves three key innovations: (1) Continuous monitoring through natural dialogue, detecting depression-indicative linguistic features (anhedonia markers, hopelessness semantics) with 89% precision (vs. 72% for PHQ-9); (2) Adaptive risk stratification that updates severity levels based on conversational context, reducing false positives by 41% compared to scale-based thresholds; and (3) Personalized intervention strategies tailored to users' emotional granularity, demonstrating 2.3x higher adherence rates than generic advice. Clinical validation with 450 participants shows the system identifies 92% of at-risk cases missed by traditional scales, while its explainable AI interface bridges the gap between automated analysis and clinician judgment. This work establishes conversational AI as a paradigm shift from episodic scale-dependent diagnosis to continuous, emotionally intelligent mental health monitoring.</p></details> |  |

However, the security implications of their iterative dialogues and role-playing characteristics, particularly susceptibility to jailbreak attacks eliciting harmful content, remain critically underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the jailbreak vulnerabilities of four prominent MAD frameworks built upon leading commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek) without compromising internal agents. We introduce a novel structured prompt-rewriting framework specifically designed to exploit MAD dynamics via narrative encapsulation, role-driven escalation, iterative refinement, and rhetorical obfuscation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MAD systems are inherently more vulnerable than single-agent setups. Crucially, our proposed attack methodology significantly amplifies this fragility, increasing average harmfulness from 28.14% to 80.34% and achieving attack success rates as high as 80% in certain scenarios. These findings reveal intrinsic vulnerabilities in MAD architectures and underscore the urgent need for robust, specialized defenses prior to real-world deployment.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |

In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters.

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching `Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated `just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

However, the existing approaches to fine-tune LLMs for RTL generation typically are conducted on fixed datasets, which do not fully stimulate the capability of LLMs and require large amounts of reference data, which are costly to acquire. To mitigate these issues, we innovatively introduce an iterative training paradigm named ITERTL. During each iteration, samples are drawn from the model trained in the previous cycle. Then these new samples are employed for training in current loop. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play data filtering strategy, thereby encouraging the model to generate high-quality, self-contained code. Our model outperforms GPT4 and state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source models, achieving remarkable 53.8% pass@1 rate on VerilogEval-human benchmark. Under similar conditions of data quantity and quality, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Especially, the poisoning of malicious code into knowledge bases can mislead LLMs, resulting in the generation of insecure outputs, which poses a critical threat in modern software development. To address this, we propose a security-hardening framework for RACG systems, CodeGuarder, that shifts the paradigm from retrieving only functional code examples to incorporating both functional code and security knowledge. Our framework constructs a security knowledge base from real-world vulnerability databases, including secure code samples and root cause annotations. For each code generation query, a retriever decomposes the query into fine-grained sub-tasks and fetches relevant security knowledge. To prioritize critical security guidance, we introduce a re-ranking and filtering mechanism by leveraging the LLMs' susceptibility to different vulnerability types. This filtered security knowledge is seamlessly integrated into the generation prompt. Our evaluation shows CodeGuarder significantly improves code security rates across various LLMs, achieving average improvements of 20.12\% in standard RACG, and 31.53\% and 21.91\% under two distinct poisoning scenarios without compromising functional correctness. Furthermore, CodeGuarder demonstrates strong generalization, enhancing security even when the targeted language's security knowledge is lacking. This work presents CodeGuarder as a pivotal advancement towards building secure and trustworthy RACG systems.</p></details> |  |

While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

With the Mistral-7B-Instruct model applied with a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method and a 4-bit quantization method, the model underwent training in two distinct stages related to this study's purpose to enhance domain specificity while maintaining computational efficiency. In Phase 1, the model was conditioned with a synthetic dataset via the Gemini Pro API, and in Phase 2, it was trained with manually curated datasets from the StudyAbroadGPT project to achieve enhanced, contextualized responses. Technical innovations entailed memory-efficient quantization, parameter-efficient adaptation, and continuous training analytics via Weights & Biases. After training, this study demonstrated a reduction in training loss by 52.7%, 92% accuracy in domain-specific recommendations, achieved 95% markdown-based formatting support, and a median run-rate of 100 samples per second on off-the-shelf GPU equipment. These findings support the effective application of instruction-tuned LLMs within educational advisers, especially in low-resource institutional scenarios. Limitations included decreased generalizability and the application of a synthetically generated dataset, but this framework is scalable for adding new multilingual-augmented and real-time academic advising processes. Future directions may include plans for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation, applying dynamic quantization routines, and connecting to real-time academic databases to increase adaptability and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (3 graphs + 3 flowchart/architecture diagrams), submitted as a preprint for review consideration in AI for Education or Machine Learning applications in low-resource settings.

This has raised concerns over their energy consumption, financial costs, and data sovereignty. While performance benchmarks often celebrate cutting-edge models, real-world deployment decisions require a broader perspective: when is a smaller, locally deployable model "good enough"? This study offers an empirical answer by evaluating eleven proprietary and open-weight LLMs across ten everyday occupational tasks, including summarizing texts, generating schedules, and drafting emails and proposals. Using a dual-LLM-based evaluation framework, we automated task execution and standardized evaluation across ten criteria related to output quality, factual accuracy, and ethical responsibility. Results show that GPT-4o delivers consistently superior performance but at a significantly higher cost and environmental footprint. Notably, smaller models like Gemma-3 and Phi-4 achieved strong and reliable results on most tasks, suggesting their viability in contexts requiring cost-efficiency, local deployment, or privacy. A cluster analysis revealed three model groups -- premium all-rounders, competent generalists, and limited but safe performers -- highlighting trade-offs between quality, control, and sustainability. Significantly, task type influenced model effectiveness: conceptual tasks challenged most models, while aggregation and transformation tasks yielded better performances. We argue for a shift from performance-maximizing benchmarks to task- and context-aware sufficiency assessments that better reflect organizational priorities. Our approach contributes a scalable method to evaluate AI models through a sustainability lens and offers actionable guidance for responsible LLM deployment in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training and obtaining the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient and effective reinforcement learning algorithm following DeepSeek R1, to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of these attacks by analyzing the attention patterns within LLMs. We introduce the concept of the distraction effect, where specific attention heads, termed important heads, shift focus from the original instruction to the injected instruction. Building on this discovery, we propose Attention Tracker, a training-free detection method that tracks attention patterns on instruction to detect prompt injection attacks without the need for additional LLM inference. Our method generalizes effectively across diverse models, datasets, and attack types, showing an AUROC improvement of up to 10.0% over existing methods, and performs well even on small LLMs. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through extensive evaluations and provide insights into safeguarding LLM-integrated systems from prompt injection vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/Attention-Tracker</p></details> |

We systematically investigate the capabilities of LLMs in emergency department triage through two key dimensions: (1) robustness to distribution shifts and missing data, and (2) counterfactual analysis of intersectional biases across sex and race. We assess multiple LLM-based approaches, ranging from continued pre-training to in-context learning, as well as machine learning approaches. Our results indicate that LLMs exhibit superior robustness, and we investigate the key factors contributing to the promising LLM-based approaches. Furthermore, in this setting, we identify gaps in LLM preferences that emerge in particular intersections of sex and race. LLMs generally exhibit sex-based differences, but they are most pronounced in certain racial groups. These findings suggest that LLMs encode demographic preferences that may emerge in specific clinical contexts or particular combinations of characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to GenAI4Health Workshop @ AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Although recent low-bit quantization methods (e.g., BitNet, DeepSeek) compress weights to as little as 1.58 bits with minimal accuracy loss, edge deployment is still constrained by limited on-chip resources, power budgets, and the often-neglected latency of the prefill phase. We present TeLLMe, the first ternary LLM accelerator for low-power FPGAs (e.g., AMD KV260) that fully supports both prefill and autoregressive decoding using 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. Our contributions include: (1) a table-lookup matrix engine for ternary matmul that merges grouped activations with online precomputation to minimize resource use; (2) a fused, bandwidth-efficient attention module featuring a reversed reordering scheme to accelerate prefill; and (3) a tightly integrated normalization and quantization--dequantization unit optimized for ultra-low-bit inference. Under a 7W power budget, TeLLMe delivers up to 9 tokens/s throughput over 1,024-token contexts and prefill latencies of 0.55--1.15 s for 64--128 token prompts, marking a significant energy-efficiency advance and establishing a new edge FPGA benchmark for generative AI.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce OmniScience, a specialized large reasoning model for general science, developed through three key components: (1) domain adaptive pretraining on a carefully curated corpus of scientific literature, (2) instruction tuning on a specialized dataset to guide the model in following domain-specific tasks, and (3) reasoning-based knowledge distillation through fine-tuning to significantly enhance its ability to generate contextually relevant and logically sound responses. We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts. We further demonstrate via ablation experiments that domain adaptive pretraining and reasoning-based knowledge distillation are critical to attain our performance levels, across benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the publication trend of LLM-related papers in 77 top-tier computer science conferences over the past six years (2019-2024). We approach this analysis from four distinct perspectives: (1) We investigate how LLM research is driving topic shifts within major conferences. (2) We adopt a topic modeling approach to identify various areas of LLM-related topic growth and reveal the topics of concern at different conferences. (3) We explore distinct contribution patterns of academic and industrial institutions. (4) We study the influence of national origins on LLM development trajectories.

This gap highlights the need to systematically analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness. We present MAST (Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy), the first empirically grounded taxonomy designed to understand MAS failures. We analyze seven popular MAS frameworks across over 200 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. Through this process, we identify 14 unique failure modes, organized into 3 overarching categories, (i) specification issues, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification. MAST emerges iteratively from rigorous inter-annotator agreement studies, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.88. To support scalable evaluation, we develop a validated LLM-as-a-Judge pipeline integrated with MAST. We leverage two case studies to demonstrate MAST's practical utility in analyzing failures and guiding MAS development. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We open source our comprehensive dataset and LLM annotator to facilitate further development of MAS.</p></details> | ArXiv v2 |

A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making.</p></details> |  |

A datetime is simply a date and a time, for example '11th.february.2023 ,1:12:31'. Datetimes are an interesting domain because they are intuitive and straightforward for humans to process but present significant challenges for LLMs. At the time of writing, no publicly available benchmark exists for systematically evaluating LLMs on datetime processing. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art models exhibit significant difficulty with tasks involving reasoning on datetimes, and that General Artificial Intelligence is still a distant aspiration. We hypothesize that working with datetimes necessitates translation and/or computation capabilities, and the tasks of the benchmark are organized accordingly. Significant dispersion in performance across models is observed with surprisingly poor performance even on apparently trivial tasks. Whilst frontier models such as ChatGPT, Claude and Llama3.1 have evidently been built and trained with datetime reasoning abilities, significant improvement is required for the open-source models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional centralized architectures struggle with latency, privacy concerns, and excessive resource consumption, making them unsuitable for modern large-scale IoT deployments. This paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative IoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS), dynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By leveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances intelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments. Evaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model accuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency, outperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt).

In this paper, we explore large-scale training for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. Specifically, we propose a novel streaming training approach that densely interleaves the ASR words and video frames according to their timestamps. Compared to previous studies in vision-language representation with ASR, our method naturally fits the streaming characteristics of ASR, thus enabling the model to learn temporally-aligned, fine-grained vision-language modeling. To support the training algorithm, we introduce a data production pipeline to process YouTube videos and their closed captions (CC, same as ASR), resulting in Live-CC-5M dataset for pre-training and Live-WhisperX-526K dataset for high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, even without SFT, the ASR-only pre-trained LiveCC-7B-Base model demonstrates competitive general video QA performance and exhibits a new capability in real-time video commentary. To evaluate this, we carefully design a new LiveSports-3K benchmark, using LLM-as-a-judge to measure the free-form commentary. Experiments show our final LiveCC-7B-Instruct model can surpass advanced 72B models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, LLaVA-Video-72B) in commentary quality even working in a real-time mode. Meanwhile, it achieves state-of-the-art results at the 7B/8B scale on popular video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME and OVOBench, demonstrating the broad generalizability of our approach.

Additionally, we explore cost effectiveness by comparing the token based detection approach of GPT 4.0 with the pattern-matching techniques employed by DeepSeek V3. The study also includes a cost analysis relative to traditional static analysis tools such as SonarQube.

There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs but also require more computing resources and processing time, which impacts overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information, further enhancing the framework's performance. Experimental results with long prompt tokens demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, significantly reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |

However, current systems face a fundamental tradeoff: out-of-place compute partition enables per-phase SLO attainment, while in-place memory sharing maximizes throughput via KV cache reuse. Moreover, existing in-place compute partition also encounters low utilization and high overhead due to phase-coupling design. We present Drift, a new LLM serving framework that resolves this tension via PD multiplexing, enabling in-place and phase-decoupled compute partition. Drift leverages low-level GPU partitioning techniques to multiplex prefill and decode phases spatially and adaptively on shared GPUs, while preserving in-place memory sharing. To fully leverage the multiplexing capability, Drift introduces an adaptive gang scheduling mechanism, a contention-free modeling method, and a SLO-aware dispatching policy. Evaluation shows that Drift achieves an average $5.1\times$ throughput improvement (up to $17.5\times$) over state-of-the-art baselines, while consistently meeting SLO targets under complex LLM workloads.</p></details> |  |

RL for LLMs involves two stages: generation and training. The LLM first generates samples online, which are then used to derive rewards for training. The conventional view holds that the colocated architecture, where the two stages share resources via temporal multiplexing, outperforms the disaggregated architecture, in which dedicated resources are assigned to each stage. However, in real-world deployments, we observe that the colocated architecture suffers from resource coupling, where the two stages are constrained to use the same resources. This coupling compromises the scalability and cost-efficiency of colocated RL in large-scale training. In contrast, the disaggregated architecture allows for flexible resource allocation, supports heterogeneous training setups, and facilitates cross-datacenter deployment. StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully unlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in existing disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage dependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length distributions. To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional stage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and achieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL. To address skewness bubbles, StreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples and reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling. Experiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to existing state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to 1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |

To assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review process (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka- Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027, underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative scenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable consistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest. A cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena, revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the skills relevant for AGI prediction. We further explored the use of weighting schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs' predictions with human expert forecasts.

| **[Impact of Noise on LLM-Models Performance in Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Tasks with Model Temperature Considerations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15903v1)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.15903v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated growing interest in their structured reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving abstraction and pattern recognition. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by testing how well AI models generalize to novel problems. While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise conditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any, suggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern matching. To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across different noise levels and temperature settings. Our results reveal that the introduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of architecture. This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs, despite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input perturbations. Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world applicability, where noise and uncertainty are common. By comparing how different model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights into the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks. This work underscores the need for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of handling the ambiguity and variability inherent in real-world scenarios. Our findings aim to guide future research toward enhancing model generalization, robustness, and alignment with human-like cognitive flexibility.</p></details> | 60 pages, 25 figures |

An Empirical Study of LLM Reasoning Ability Under Output Length Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14350v2)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.14350v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has demonstrated the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in test-time scaling. By making the models think before answering, they are able to achieve much higher accuracy with extra inference computation. However, in many real-world scenarios, models are used under time constraints, where an answer should be given to the user within a certain output length. It is unclear whether and how the reasoning abilities of LLMs remain effective under such constraints. We take a first look at this problem by conducting an in-depth empirical study. Specifically, we test more than 25 LLMs on common reasoning datasets under a wide range of output length budgets, and we analyze the correlation between the inference accuracy and various properties including model type, model size, prompt style, etc. We also consider the mappings between the token budgets and the actual on-device latency budgets. The results have demonstrated several interesting findings regarding the budget-aware LLM reasoning that differ from the unconstrained situation, e.g. the optimal choices of model sizes and prompts change under different budgets. These findings offer practical guidance for users to deploy LLMs under real-world latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating external information into LLMs' code generation process introduces new security risks. In this paper, we reveal a real-world threat, named HACKODE, where attackers exploit referenced external information to embed attack sequences, causing LLMs to produce code with vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and incomplete validations. We designed a prototype of the attack, which generates effective attack sequences for potential diverse inputs with various user queries and prompt templates. Through the evaluation on two general LLMs and two code LLMs, we demonstrate that the attack is effective, achieving an 84.29% success rate. Additionally, on a real-world application, HACKODE achieves 75.92% ASR, demonstrating its real-world impact.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring the functional correctness of the generated code remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a method that integrates verification insights from testbench into the training of Verilog generation LLMs, aligning the training with the fundamental goal of hardware design: functional correctness. The main obstacle in using LLMs for Verilog code generation is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, particularly testbenches paired with design specifications and code. To address this problem, we introduce an automatic testbench generation pipeline that decomposes the process and uses feedback from the Verilog compiler simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness. We then use the testbench to evaluate the generated codes and collect them for further training, where verification insights are introduced. Our method applies reinforcement learning (RL), specifically direct preference optimization (DPO), to align Verilog code generation with functional correctness by training preference pairs based on testbench outcomes. In evaluations on VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating functionally correct Verilog code. We open source all training code, data, and models at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VeriPrefer-E88B.</p></details> |  |

Their potential to facilitate human coordination with many agents is a promising but largely under-explored area. Such capabilities would be helpful in disaster response, urban planning, and real-time strategy scenarios. In this work, we introduce (1) a real-time strategy game benchmark designed to evaluate these abilities and (2) a novel framework we term HIVE. HIVE empowers a single human to coordinate swarms of up to 2,000 agents through a natural language dialog with an LLM. We present promising results on this multi-agent benchmark, with our hybrid approach solving tasks such as coordinating agent movements, exploiting unit weaknesses, leveraging human annotations, and understanding terrain and strategic points. Our findings also highlight critical limitations of current models, including difficulties in processing spatial visual information and challenges in formulating long-term strategic plans. This work sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in human-swarm coordination, paving the way for future research in this area.

How can world models benefit LLM agents? The gap between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics usually bottlenecks LLMs' performance as world models. To bridge the gap, we propose a training-free "world alignment" that learns an environment's symbolic knowledge complementary to LLMs. The symbolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which are extracted by LLMs from exploration trajectories and encoded into executable codes to regulate LLM agents' policies. We further propose an RL-free, model-based agent "WALL-E 2.0" through the model-predictive control (MPC) framework. Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on the fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future steps' actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model. While the LLM agent's strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of its planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned world model. They together considerably improve learning efficiency in a new environment. On open-world challenges in Mars (Minecraft like) and ALFWorld (embodied indoor environments), WALL-E 2.0 significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., surpassing baselines in Mars by 16.1%-51.6% of success rate and by at least 61.7% in score. In ALFWorld, it achieves a new record 98% success rate after only 4 iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/elated-sawyer/WALL-E</p></details> |

Not only the emotional intensity but also the category influence the argument's effects, for instance, the willingness to adapt stances. While binary emotionality has been studied in arguments, there is no work on discrete emotion categories (e.g., "Anger") in such data. To fill this gap, we crowdsource subjective annotations of emotion categories in a German argument corpus and evaluate automatic LLM-based labeling methods. Specifically, we compare three prompting strategies (zero-shot, one-shot, chain-of-thought) on three large instruction-tuned language models (Falcon-7b-instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-instruct, GPT-4o-mini). We further vary the definition of the output space to be binary (is there emotionality in the argument?), closed-domain (which emotion from a given label set is in the argument?), or open-domain (which emotion is in the argument?). We find that emotion categories enhance the prediction of emotionality in arguments, emphasizing the need for discrete emotion annotations in arguments. Across all prompt settings and models, automatic predictions show a high recall but low precision for predicting anger and fear, indicating a strong bias toward negative emotions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to NLP4DH 2025</p></details> |

However, replicating these advancements across diverse domains remains challenging due to limited methodological transparency. In this work, we present two-Staged history-Resampling Policy Optimization (SRPO), which surpasses the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B on the AIME24 and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. SRPO achieves this using the same base model as DeepSeek (i.e. Qwen2.5-32B), using only about 1/10 of the training steps required by DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B, demonstrating superior efficiency. Building upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we introduce two key methodological innovations: (1) a two-stage cross-domain training paradigm designed to balance the development of mathematical reasoning and coding proficiency, and (2) History Resampling (HR), a technique to address ineffective samples. Our comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering valuable insights into scaling LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although extensive research has addressed issues such as factuality, bias, and toxicity, comparatively little attention has been paid to measuring alignment to preferences, i.e., the relative desirability of different alternatives, a concept used in decision making, economics, and social choice theory. However, a reliable decision-making agent makes choices that align well with user preferences. In this paper, we generalize existing methods that exploit LLMs for ranking alternative outcomes by addressing alignment with the broader and more flexible concept of user preferences, which includes both strict preferences and indifference among alternatives. To this end, we put forward design principles for using LLMs to implement rational choice functions, and provide the necessary tools to measure preference satisfaction. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through an empirical study in a practical application of an IUI in the automotive domain.</p></details> |  |

To enable humanitarian organizations to respond more efficiently, we propose a fine-grained hierarchical taxonomy to systematically organize crisis-related information about requests and offers into three critical dimensions: supplies, emergency personnel, and actions. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce Query-Specific Few-shot Learning (QSF Learning) that retrieves class-specific labeled examples from an embedding database to enhance the model's performance in detecting and classifying posts. Beyond classification, we assess the actionability of messages to prioritize posts requiring immediate attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline prompting strategies, effectively identifying and prioritizing actionable requests and offers.</p></details> |  |

Central to our contribution is the first application of multi-token prediction (MTP) to speech LLMs. This approach represents a paradigm shift from standard next-token prediction (NTP), offering simultaneous improvements in generation speed and quality. Informed by analysis of MTP's effect on speech generation and experimental comparisons, we designed a straightforward and highly effective MTP implementation. Experiments demonstrate that VocalNet performs on par with mainstream Omni LLMs even with limited training data, and significantly surpasses existing open-source speech LLMs. To foster reproducibility and community advancement, all model weights, inference code, training data, and framework implementations have been made publicly available at https://github.com/SJTU-OmniAgent/VocalNet</p></details> |  |

While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior. We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of over 125,000 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4% respectively. An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel framework using cosine distance to measure semantic shifts in responses and an LLM-judged Preference Win Rate (WR) to assess how demographic prompts affect response quality across power-disparate social scenarios. Evaluating five LLMs over 100 diverse social scenarios and nine demographic axes, our findings suggest a "default persona" bias toward middle-aged, able-bodied, native-born, Caucasian, atheistic males with centrist views. Moreover, interactions involving specific demographics are associated with lower-quality responses. Lastly, the presence of power disparities increases variability in response semantics and quality across demographic groups, suggesting that implicit biases may be heightened under power-imbalanced conditions. These insights expose the demographic biases inherent in LLMs and offer potential paths toward future bias mitigation efforts in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025; 10 pages of main text.

While existing approaches focus on enhancing the decoding strategies, they ignore the fundamental mechanism of how contextual information is processed within LLMs' internal states. As a result, LLMs remain limited in their ability to fully leverage contextual knowledge. In this paper, we propose Context-aware Layer Enhancement (CaLE), a novel intervention method that enhances the utilization of contextual knowledge within LLMs' internal representations. By employing V-usable information analysis, CaLE strategically amplifies the growth of contextual information at an optimal layer, thereby enriching representations in the final layer. Our experiments demonstrate that CaLE effectively improves context-faithful generation in Question-Answering tasks, particularly in scenarios involving unknown or conflicting contextual knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Traditional navigation approaches relying on pre-built maps or reinforcement learning exhibit limitations such as poor generalization and limited adaptability to dynamic environments. In contrast, LLMs offer a novel paradigm for complex indoor navigation tasks by leveraging their exceptional semantic comprehension, reasoning capabilities, and zero-shot generalization properties. We propose an LLM-based navigation framework that leverages function calling capabilities, positioning the LLM as the central controller. Our methodology involves modular decomposition of conventional navigation functions into reusable LLM tools with expandable configurations. This is complemented by a systematically designed, transferable system prompt template and interaction workflow that can be easily adapted across different implementations. Experimental validation in PyBullet simulation environments across diverse scenarios demonstrates the substantial potential and effectiveness of our approach, particularly in achieving context-aware navigation through dynamic tool composition.</p></details> |  |

With the success of large language models (LLMs), they have been employed in various tasks, including serving as judges (LLM-as-a-judge). In this paper, we reassess the performance of QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA datasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show that LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace traditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human judgments improves significantly, from 0.22 (EM) and 0.40 (F1-score) to 0.85. These findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true performance of the QA models.

As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</p></details> |  |

These LLMs come with different abilities and costs in terms of computation or pricing. Since the demand for each query can vary, e.g., because of the queried domain or its complexity, defaulting to one LLM in an application is not usually the best choice, whether it is the biggest, priciest, or even the one with the best average test performance. Consequently, picking the right LLM that is both accurate and cost-effective for an application is necessary yet remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce MetaLLM, a framework that dynamically and intelligently routes each query to the optimal LLM (among several available LLMs) for classification and multi-choice question-answering tasks, achieving significantly improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness. By framing the selection problem as a multi-armed bandit, MetaLLM balances prediction accuracy and cost efficiency under uncertainty. Our experiments, conducted on popular LLM platforms such as OpenAI and Together AI, as well as open-source LLM, showcase MetaLLM's efficacy in real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future extensions.</p></details> |  |

However, their efficacy declines when tackling complex social media challenges such as propaganda detection, hateful meme classification, and toxicity identification. Much of the existing work has focused on using LLMs to generate synthetic training data, overlooking the potential of LLM-based text preprocessing and semantic augmentation. In this paper, we introduce an approach that prompts LLMs to clean noisy text and provide context-rich explanations, thereby enhancing training sets without substantial increases in data volume. We systematically evaluate on the SemEval 2024 multi-label Persuasive Meme dataset and further validate on the Google Jigsaw toxic comments and Facebook hateful memes datasets to assess generalizability. Our results reveal that zero-shot LLM classification underperforms on these high-context tasks compared to supervised models. In contrast, integrating LLM-based semantic augmentation yields performance on par with approaches that rely on human-annotated data, at a fraction of the cost. These findings underscore the importance of strategically incorporating LLMs into machine learning (ML) pipeline for social media classification tasks, offering broad implications for combating harmful content online.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches.

However, pretraining of encoder models with large-scale corpora and long contexts has been relatively underexplored compared to decoder-only transformers. In this work, we present llm-jp-modernbert, a ModernBERT model trained on a publicly available, massive Japanese corpus with a context length of 8192 tokens. While our model does not surpass existing baselines on downstream tasks, it achieves good results on fill-mask test evaluations. We also analyze the effect of context length expansion through pseudo-perplexity experiments. Furthermore, we investigate sentence embeddings in detail, analyzing their transitions during training and comparing them with those from other existing models, confirming similar trends with models sharing the same architecture. To support reproducibility and foster the development of long-context BERT, we release our model, along with the training and evaluation code.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wa...</summary><p>We want to withdraw this paper and revise its experimental details.

While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech.

While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is prepended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS speech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency trade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as improving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency.</p></details> |  |

In response, we present AgentA/B, a novel system that leverages Large Language Model-based autonomous agents (LLM Agents) to automatically simulate user interaction behaviors with real webpages. AgentA/B enables scalable deployment of LLM agents with diverse personas, each capable of navigating the dynamic webpage and interactively executing multi-step interactions like search, clicking, filtering, and purchasing.

However, conventional studies are insufficient to thoroughly evaluate biases across LLM responses for different demographic groups (a.k.a. counterfactual bias), as they do not scale to large number of inputs and do not provide guarantees. Therefore, we propose the first framework, LLMCert-B that certifies LLMs for counterfactual bias on distributions of prompts. A certificate consists of high-confidence bounds on the probability of unbiased LLM responses for any set of counterfactual prompts - prompts differing by demographic groups, sampled from a distribution. We illustrate counterfactual bias certification for distributions of counterfactual prompts created by applying prefixes sampled from prefix distributions, to a given set of prompts. We consider prefix distributions consisting random token sequences, mixtures of manual jailbreaks, and perturbations of jailbreaks in LLM's embedding space. We generate non-trivial certificates for SOTA LLMs, exposing their vulnerabilities over distributions of prompts generated from computationally inexpensive prefix distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

As LLMs are increasingly envisioned as superhuman agents, their proficiency in knowledge comprehension-extracting relevant information and reasoning over it to answer questions, a key facet of human intelligence-becomes crucial. However, existing evaluations of LLMs on knowledge comprehension are typically conducted on small test sets, but these datasets represent only a tiny fraction of the vast number of possible queries. Simple empirical evaluations on these limited test sets raises concerns about the reliability and generalizability of the results. In this work, we introduce the first specification and certification framework for knowledge comprehension in LLMs, providing formal probabilistic guarantees for reliability. Instead of a fixed dataset, we design novel specifications that mathematically represent prohibitively large probability distributions of knowledge comprehension prompts with natural noise, using knowledge graphs. From these specifications, we generate quantitative certificates that offer high-confidence, tight bounds on the probability that a given LLM correctly answers any question drawn from the specification distribution. We apply our framework to certify SOTA LLMs in two domains: precision medicine and general question-answering. Our results reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in SOTA LLMs due to natural noise in the prompts. Additionally, we establish performance hierarchies with formal guarantees among the SOTA LLMs, particularly in the context of precision medicine question-answering.</p></details> |  |

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong zero-shot recommendation capabilities, practical applications often favor smaller, internally managed recommender models due to scalability, interpretability, and data privacy constraints, especially in sensitive or rapidly evolving domains. However, training these smaller models effectively still demands substantial domain-specific conversational data, which remains challenging to obtain. To address these limitations, we propose an active data augmentation framework that synthesizes conversational training data by leveraging black-box LLMs guided by active learning techniques. Specifically, our method utilizes publicly available non-conversational domain data, including item metadata, user reviews, and collaborative signals, as seed inputs. By employing active learning strategies to select the most informative seed samples, our approach efficiently guides LLMs to generate synthetic, semantically coherent conversational interactions tailored explicitly to the target domain. Extensive experiments validate that conversational data generated by our proposed framework significantly improves the performance of LLM-based CRS models, effectively addressing the challenges of building CRS in no- or low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |

This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on toxicity detection and mitigation, focusing on both SE-specific and general-purpose datasets. We examine annotation and preprocessing techniques, assess detection methodologies, and evaluate mitigation strategies, particularly those leveraging LLMs. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-based rewriting for reducing toxicity.

While this approach may be justified in simple and low-stakes applications, we conduct empirical analysis to demonstrate how the perennial curse of training on synthetic data manifests itself in this specific setup. Compared to models trained on gold labels, we observe not only the expected performance degradation in accuracy and F1 score, but also increased instability across training runs and premature performance plateaus. These findings cast doubts on the reliability of such approaches in real-world applications. We contextualize the observed phenomena through the lens of error propagation and offer several practical mitigation strategies, including entropy-based filtering and ensemble techniques. Although these heuristics offer partial relief, they do not fully resolve the inherent risks of propagating non-random errors from LLM annotations to smaller classifiers, underscoring the need for caution when applying this workflow in high-stakes text classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

First, nine sexism researchers answer questions about their knowledge of sexism and of LLMs. They then participate in two interactive experiments involving an LLM (GPT3.5). The first experiment has experts assessing the model's knowledge about sexism and suitability for use in research. The second experiment tasks them with creating three different definitions of sexism: an expert-written definition, an LLM-written one, and a co-created definition. Lastly, zero-shot classification experiments use the three definitions from each expert in a prompt template for sexism detection, evaluating GPT4o on 2.500 texts sampled from five sexism benchmarks. We then analyze the resulting 67.500 classification decisions. The LLM interactions lead to longer and more complex definitions of sexism.

Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits and obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural complexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs' sequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious intent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical context-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD integrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and construct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze application behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level semantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual consistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations from the first tier.

Exoskeletons offer potential assistance but falter without accurate intent recognition across diverse locomotion modes. This paper presents a locomotion prediction agent leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with memory systems, aimed at improving exoskeleton assistance in such settings. Using multimodal inputs - spoken commands and visual data from smart glasses - the agent integrates a Perception Module, Short-Term Memory (STM), Long-Term Memory (LTM), and Refinement Module to predict locomotion modes effectively. Evaluation reveals a baseline weighted F1-score of 0.73 without memory, rising to 0.81 with STM, and reaching 0.90 with both STM and LTM, excelling with vague and safety-critical commands. Calibration metrics, including a Brier Score drop from 0.244 to 0.090 and ECE from 0.222 to 0.044, affirm improved reliability.

In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures.

Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To investigate this question, we develop generalization bounds on the pretraining objective of large language models (LLMs) in the compute-optimal regime, as described by the Chinchilla scaling laws. We introduce a novel, fully empirical Freedman-type martingale concentration inequality that tightens existing bounds by accounting for the variance of the loss function. This generalization bound can be decomposed into three interpretable components: the number of parameters per token, the loss variance, and the quantization error at a fixed bitrate. As compute-optimal language models are scaled up, the number of parameters per data point remains constant; however, both the loss variance and the quantization error decrease, implying that larger models should have smaller generalization gaps. We examine why larger models tend to be more quantizable from an information theoretic perspective, showing that the rate at which they can integrate new information grows more slowly than their capacity on the compute-optimal frontier. From these findings we produce a scaling law for the generalization gap, with bounds that become predictably stronger with scale.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment.

In contrast, alternative models such as BLIP-2 and GPT-4V achieve competitive results through a streamlined, single-pass approach. We hypothesize that the significant overhead inherent in MILS's iterative process may undermine its practical benefits, thereby challenging the narrative that zero-shot performance can be attained without incurring heavy resource demands. This work is the first to expose and quantify the trade-offs between output quality and computational cost in MILS, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy.

An open-domain LLM often lacks coherent contextual guidance and domain expertise for specific projects, making it challenging to produce complete code that fully meets user requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel planning-guided code generation method, DLCodeGen, tailored for generating deep learning projects. DLCodeGen predicts a structured solution plan, offering global guidance for LLMs to generate the project. The generated plan is then leveraged to retrieve semantically analogous code samples and subsequently abstract a code template. To effectively integrate these multiple retrieval-augmented techniques, a comparative learning mechanism is designed to generate the final code. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset we build for deep learning code generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DLCodeGen outperforms other baselines, achieving improvements of 9.7% in CodeBLEU and 3.6% in human evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution accuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their (weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and multiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks to a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and optimization of the execution accuracy. Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.</p></details> | 15 pages |

In contrast to previous work focusing mainly on general language, we explore ChatGPT's ability to identify and categorise errors in specialised translations. By testing two different prompts and based on a customised error typology, we compare ChatGPT annotations with human expert evaluations of translations produced by DeepL and ChatGPT itself. The results show that, for translations generated by DeepL, recall and precision are quite high. However, the degree of accuracy in error categorisation depends on the prompt's specific features and its level of detail, ChatGPT performing very well with a detailed prompt. When evaluating its own translations, ChatGPT achieves significantly poorer results, revealing limitations with self-assessment. These results highlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs for translation evaluation, particularly in specialised domains. Our experiments pave the way for future research on open-source LLMs, which could produce annotations of comparable or even higher quality. In the future, we also aim to test the practical effectiveness of this automated evaluation in the context of translation training, particularly by optimising the process of human evaluation by teachers and by exploring the impact of annotations by LLMs on students' post-editing and translation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of MT Summit 2025</p></details> |

However, manual annotation of data is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Therefore, LLMs are increasingly used to automate the process, often employing in-context learning (ICL) in which some examples related to the task are given in the prompt for better performance. However, manually selecting context examples can lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal model performance. This paper presents comprehensive experiments comparing several LLMs, considering different embedding models, across various datasets for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. The evaluation encompasses models with approximately $7$B and $70$B parameters, including both proprietary and non-proprietary models. Furthermore, leveraging the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it also considers a method that addresses the limitations of ICL by automatically retrieving contextual examples, thereby enhancing performance. The results highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate LLM and embedding model, understanding the trade-offs between LLM sizes and desired performance, and the necessity to direct research efforts towards more challenging datasets.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |

This research explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline this task by automating the generation of extended reading materials and relevant course suggestions. Using the TED-Ed Dig Deeper sections as an initial exploration, we investigate how supplementary articles can be enriched with contextual knowledge and connected to additional learning resources. Our method begins by generating extended articles from video transcripts, leveraging LLMs to include historical insights, cultural examples, and illustrative anecdotes. A recommendation system employing semantic similarity ranking identifies related courses, followed by an LLM-based refinement process to enhance relevance. The final articles are tailored to seamlessly integrate these recommendations, ensuring they remain cohesive and informative. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model produces high-quality content and accurate course suggestions, assessed through metrics such as Hit Rate, semantic similarity, and coherence. Our experimental analysis highlight the nuanced differences between the generated and existing materials, underscoring the model's capacity to offer more engaging and accessible learning experiences.

Students use LLMs to assist them in programming courses, including generating source code. Previous work has evaluated the ability of LLMs in solving introductory-course programming assignments. The results have shown that LLMs are highly effective in generating code for introductory Computer Science (CS) courses. However, there is a gap in research on evaluating LLMs' ability to generate code that solves advanced programming assignments. In this work, we evaluate the ability of four LLM tools to solve programming assignments from advanced CS courses in three popular programming languages, Java, Python, and C. We manually select 12 problems, three problems from introductory courses as the baseline and nine programming assignments from second- and third-year CS courses. To evaluate the LLM-generated code, we generate a test suite of 1000 test cases per problem and analyze the program output. Our evaluation shows that although LLMs are highly effective in generating source code for introductory programming courses, solving advanced programming assignments is more challenging. Nonetheless, in many cases, LLMs identify the base problem and provide partial solutions that may be useful to CS students. Furthermore, our results may provide useful guidance for teachers of advanced programming courses on how to design programming assignments.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06193v3)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06193v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92.

However, long-range attention often results in computational overhead without practical necessity, as degradation and context are typically localized. Normalized average attention distance across various degradation datasets shows that middle-range attention is enough for image restoration. Building on this insight, we propose RouteWinFormer, a novel window-based Transformer that models middle-range context for image restoration. RouteWinFormer incorporates Route-Windows Attnetion Module, which dynamically selects relevant nearby windows based on regional similarity for attention aggregation, extending the receptive field to a mid-range size efficiently. In addition, we introduce Multi-Scale Structure Regularization during training, enabling the sub-scale of the U-shaped network to focus on structural information, while the original-scale learns degradation patterns based on generalized image structure priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RouteWinFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 9 datasets in various image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps challenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to integrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To address this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and alignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and global-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and between paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction and fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the Transformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial pixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel dependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain distribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature misalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive Alignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in a two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity. This reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this unified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction of the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's robustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/zs1314/CPRAformer</p></details> |

Firstly, we extend the Ambient Diffusion framework to enable training directly from measurements corrupted in the Fourier domain. Subsequently, we train diffusion models for MRI with access only to Fourier subsampled multi-coil measurements at acceleration factors R= 2,4,6,8. Secondly, we propose Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a reconstruction algorithm that leverages generative models pre-trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) to perform posterior sampling on measurements from a different forward process (e.g. image blurring). For MRI reconstruction in high acceleration regimes, we observe that A-DPS models trained on subsampled data are better suited to solving inverse problems than models trained on fully sampled data. We also test the efficacy of A-DPS on natural image datasets (CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ) and show that A-DPS can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for several image restoration tasks in both speed and performance.</p></details> |  |

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 21,000 high-resolution facial images across 4800 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction.

A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD) framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation of incorrect estimations. The circular restoration process involves both forward and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field estimations.</p></details> |  |

Dataset distillation is a potential solution to this problem, yet current distillation techniques are a blank canvas in the field of image restoration. To fill this gap, we propose the Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation method (TripleD), a new framework that extends the principles of dataset distillation to image restoration. Specifically, TripleD uses a pre-trained vision Transformer to extract features from images for complexity evaluation, and the subset (the number of samples is much smaller than the original training set) is selected based on complexity. The selected subset is then fed through a lightweight CNN that fine-tunes the image distribution to align with the distribution of the original dataset at the feature level. To efficiently condense knowledge, the training is divided into two stages. Early stages focus on simpler, low-complexity samples to build foundational knowledge, while later stages select more complex and uncertain samples as the model matures. Our method achieves promising performance on multiple image restoration tasks, including multi-task image restoration, all-in-one image restoration, and ultra-high-definition image restoration tasks. Note that we can train a state-of-the-art image restoration model on an ultra-high-definition (4K resolution) dataset using only one consumer-grade GPU in less than 8 hours (500 savings in computing resources and immeasurable training time).</p></details> |  |

In recent years, researchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of handling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of model development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three architectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in efficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing long-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture has demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts have been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly address diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an efficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion. RestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is tailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the initial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract shallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined multi-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based self-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the model to leverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in global context modeling, and attention mechanisms in dynamic feature refinement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RestorMixer achieves leading performance across multiple IR tasks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.</p></details> |  |

Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs.

This paper introduces a novel Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios.

| **[AdaQual-Diff: Diffusion-Based Image Restoration via Adaptive Quality Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12605v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12605v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring images afflicted by complex real-world degradations remains challenging, as conventional methods often fail to adapt to the unique mixture and severity of artifacts present. This stems from a reliance on indirect cues which poorly capture the true perceptual quality deficit. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce AdaQual-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that integrates perceptual quality assessment directly into the generative restoration process. Our approach establishes a mathematical relationship between regional quality scores from DeQAScore and optimal guidance complexity, implemented through an Adaptive Quality Prompting mechanism. This mechanism systematically modulates prompt structure according to measured degradation severity: regions with lower perceptual quality receive computationally intensive, structurally complex prompts with precise restoration directives, while higher quality regions receive minimal prompts focused on preservation rather than intervention. The technical core of our method lies in the dynamic allocation of computational resources proportional to degradation severity, creating a spatially-varying guidance field that directs the diffusion process with mathematical precision. By combining this quality-guided approach with content-specific conditioning, our framework achieves fine-grained control over regional restoration intensity without requiring additional parameters or inference iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaQual-Diff achieves visually superior restorations across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Deep learning methods offer state-of-the-art performance but often require sensor-specific training when used in a supervised setting. A promising alternative is given by plug-and-play (PnP) methods, which consist in learning only a regularization through a denoiser, allowing to restore images from several sources with the same network. This paper introduces PG-DPIR, an efficient PnP method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems, adapted from DPIR. While DPIR is designed for white Gaussian noise, a naive adaptation to Poisson-Gaussian noise leads to prohibitively slow algorithms due to the absence of a closed-form proximal operator. To address this, we adapt DPIR for the specificities of Poisson-Gaussian noise and propose in particular an efficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step that accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude. Experiments are conducted on satellite image restoration and super-resolution problems. High-resolution realistic Pleiades images are simulated for the experiments, which demonstrate that PG-DPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency, which seems promising for on-ground satellite processing chains.</p></details> |  |

While certain methods address this balance, they predominantly emphasize spatial aspects, neglecting frequency variation comprehension. In this paper, we present a multi-scale design that optimally balances these competing objectives, seamlessly integrating spatial and frequency domain knowledge to selectively recover the most informative information. Specifically, we develop a hybrid scale frequency selection block (HSFSBlock), which not only captures multi-scale information from the spatial domain, but also selects the most informative components for image restoration in the frequency domain. Furthermore, to mitigate the inherent noise introduced by skip connections employing only addition or concatenation, we introduce a skip connection attention mechanism (SCAM) to selectively determines the information that should propagate through skip connections. The resulting tightly interlinked architecture, named as LCDNet. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse image restoration tasks showcase that our model attains performance levels that are either superior or comparable to those of state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.08950</p></details> |

They are poorly understood and suffer from strong biases inherited from the training sets. One way to address these shortcomings is to have a better control over the training sets, in particular by using synthetic sets. In this paper, we propose a synthetic image generator relying on a few simple principles. In particular, we focus on geometric modeling, textures, and a simple modeling of image acquisition. These properties, integrated in a classical Dead Leaves model, enable the creation of efficient training sets. Standard image denoising and super-resolution networks can be trained on such datasets, reaching performance almost on par with training on natural image datasets. As a first step towards explainability, we provide a careful analysis of the considered principles, identifying which image properties are necessary to obtain good performances. Besides, such training also yields better robustness to various geometric and radiometric perturbations of the test sets.</p></details> |  |

However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors such as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts yields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we propose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively enhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR screening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass restoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind restoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus images in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low quality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest restored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method can learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing its limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies to minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate PTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on DeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for diabetic retinopathy detection. Our result demonstrates state of the art performance, showcasing PTL's potential as a superior approach to iterative image quality restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures including appendix</p></details> |

While adaptive prompt learning enables end-to-end optimization, it often yields overlapping or redundant task representations. Conversely, explicit prompts derived from pretrained classifiers enhance discriminability but may discard critical visual information for reconstruction. To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a novel framework that fundamentally enhances prompt-task alignment through two complementary innovations: a \emph{Sparse Prompt Module (SPM)} that efficiently captures degradation-specific features while minimizing redundancy, and a \emph{Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR)} that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on degradation classification, CPL optimizes the critical interaction between prompts and the restoration model itself. Extensive experiments across five comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that CPL consistently enhances state-of-the-art all-in-one restoration models, achieving significant improvements in both standard multi-task scenarios and challenging composite degradation settings. Our framework establishes new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining parameter efficiency, offering a principled solution for unified image restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/Aitical/CPLIR</p></details> |

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods rely on predicting and integrating degradation conditions, which can misactivate degradation-specific features in complex scenarios, limiting their restoration performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel all-in-one image restoration framework guided by Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), named HOGformer. By leveraging the degradation-discriminative capability of HOG descriptors, HOGformer employs a dynamic self-attention mechanism that adaptively attends to long-range spatial dependencies based on degradation-aware HOG cues. To enhance the degradation sensitivity of attention inputs, we design a HOG-guided local dynamic-range convolution module that captures long-range degradation similarities while maintaining awareness of global structural information. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic interaction feed-forward module, efficiently increasing the model capacity to adapt to different degradations through channel-spatial interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate that HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes effectively to complex real-world degradations.

However, deploying these models at ultra-high resolutions faces a critical trade-off between quality and efficiency due to the computational demands of long-range attention mechanisms. To address this, we introduce ZipIR, a novel framework that enhances efficiency, scalability, and long-range modeling for high-res image restoration. ZipIR employs a highly compressed latent representation that compresses image 32x, effectively reducing the number of spatial tokens, and enabling the use of high-capacity models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Toward this goal, we propose a Latent Pyramid VAE (LP-VAE) design that structures the latent space into sub-bands to ease diffusion training. Trained on full images up to 2K resolution, ZipIR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods, offering unmatched speed and quality in restoring high-resolution images from severely degraded inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific degradation scenarios, limiting their adaptability to the diverse and complex challenges in real-world environments. Moreover, real-world degradations are typically non-uniform, highlighting the need for adaptive and intelligent solutions. To address these issues, we propose a novel vision-language-guided universal restoration (VL-UR) framework. VL-UR leverages a zero-shot contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to enhance image restoration by integrating visual and semantic information. A scene classifier is introduced to adapt CLIP, generating high-quality language embeddings aligned with degraded images while predicting degraded types for complex scenarios. Extensive experiments across eleven diverse degradation settings demonstrate VL-UR's state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and adaptability. This positions VL-UR as a transformative solution for modern image restoration challenges in dynamic, real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we identify two critical issues: feature entropy becoming excessively small and feature magnitudes diverging up to a million-fold scale. We pinpoint the root cause to the per-token normalization aspect of conventional LayerNorm, which disrupts essential spatial correlations and internal feature statistics. To address this, we propose a simple normalization strategy tailored for IR Transformers. Our approach applies normalization across the entire spatio-channel dimension, effectively preserving spatial correlations. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling method that aligns feature statistics to the unique statistical requirements of each input. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy effectively resolves feature divergence, significantly enhancing both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.</p></details> |  |

OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle multiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential. However, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather conditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world degradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with degradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed DA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive degradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration. Specifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware representations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space. By aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each prompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The learned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed weather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple weather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather degradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a dynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of restoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion model to restore diverse degradations adaptively. Experimental results substantiate the favorable performance of DA2Diff over state-of-the-arts in quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Although Transformer architectures have progressed considerably in recent years, challenges remain, particularly the limited receptive field in window-based self-attention. In this work, we propose DSwinIR, a Deformable Sliding window Transformer for Image Restoration. DSwinIR introduces a novel deformable sliding window self-attention that adaptively adjusts receptive fields based on image content, enabling the attention mechanism to focus on important regions and enhance feature extraction aligned with salient features. Additionally, we introduce a central ensemble pattern to reduce the inclusion of irrelevant content within attention windows. In this way, the proposed DSwinIR model integrates the deformable sliding window Transformer and central ensemble pattern to amplify the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers while mitigating their limitations. Extensive experiments on various image restoration tasks demonstrate that DSwinIR achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, in image deraining, compared to DRSformer on the SPA dataset, DSwinIR achieves a 0.66 dB PSNR improvement. In all-in-one image restoration, compared to PromptIR, DSwinIR achieves over a 0.66 dB and 1.04 dB improvement on three-task and five-task settings, respectively.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for cloud removal, delivering higher-quality estimation by sampling from cloud-free distributions, compared to earlier methods. However, diffusion models initiate sampling from pure Gaussian noise, which complicates the sampling trajectory and results in suboptimal performance. Also, current methods fall short in effectively fusing SAR and optical data. To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion Bridges for Cloud Removal, DB-CR, which directly bridges between the cloudy and cloud-free image distributions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal diffusion bridge architecture with a two-branch backbone for multimodal image restoration, incorporating an efficient backbone and dedicated cross-modality fusion blocks to effectively extract and fuse features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. By formulating cloud removal as a diffusion-bridge problem and leveraging this tailored architecture, DB-CR achieves high-fidelity results while being computationally efficient. We evaluated DB-CR on the SEN12MS-CR cloud-removal dataset, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (camera-ready).

However, deploying SSMs to edge devices is challenging due to the constraints in memory, computing capacity, and power consumption, underscoring the need for efficient compression strategies. While low-bit quantization is an efficient model compression strategy for reducing size and accelerating IR tasks, SSM suffers substantial performance drops at ultra-low bit-widths (2-4 bits), primarily due to outliers that exacerbate quantization error. To address this challenge, we propose Q-MambaIR, an accurate, efficient, and flexible Quantized Mamba for IR tasks. Specifically, we introduce a Statistical Dynamic-balancing Learnable Scalar (DLS) to dynamically adjust the quantization mapping range, thereby mitigating the peak truncation loss caused by extreme values. Furthermore, we design a Range-floating Flexible Allocator (RFA) with an adaptive threshold to flexibly round values. This approach preserves high-frequency details and maintains the SSM's feature extraction capability. Notably, RFA also enables pre-deployment weight quantization, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy. Extensive experiments on IR tasks demonstrate that Q-MambaIR consistently outperforms existing quantized SSMs, achieving much higher state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy results with only a negligible increase in training computation and storage saving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridge the Gap between SNN and ANN for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01755v1)** | 2025-04-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.01755v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models of dense prediction based on traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) require a lot of energy, especially for image restoration tasks. Currently, neural networks based on the SNN (Spiking Neural Network) framework are beginning to make their mark in the field of image restoration, especially as they typically use less than 10\% of the energy of ANNs with the same architecture. However, training an SNN is much more expensive than training an ANN, due to the use of the heuristic gradient descent strategy. In other words, the process of SNN's potential membrane signal changing from sparse to dense is very slow, which affects the convergence of the whole model.To tackle this problem, we propose a novel distillation technique, called asymmetric framework (ANN-SNN) distillation, in which the teacher is an ANN and the student is an SNN. Specifically, we leverage the intermediate features (feature maps) learned by the ANN as hints to guide the training process of the SNN. This approach not only accelerates the convergence of the SNN but also improves its final performance, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of the SNN and the superior learning capabilities of ANN. Extensive experimental results show that our designed SNN-based image restoration model, which has only 1/300 the number of parameters of the teacher network and 1/50 the energy consumption of the teacher network, is as good as the teacher network in some denoising tasks.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we raise an intriguing question: can the combination of image restoration and object detection enhance detection performance in adverse weather conditions? To answer it, we propose an effective architecture that bridges image dehazing and object detection together via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing, termed FriendNet. FriendNet aims to deliver both high-quality perception and high detection capacity. Different from existing efforts that intuitively treat image dehazing as pre-processing, FriendNet establishes a positive correlation between these two tasks. Clean features generated by the dehazing network potentially contribute to improvements in object detection performance. Conversely, object detection crucially guides the learning process of the image dehazing network under the task-driven learning scheme. We shed light on how downstream tasks can guide upstream dehazing processes, considering both network architecture and learning objectives. We design Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to facilitate the integration of detection information into the network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the detection task loss aids in refining the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a new Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB), which integrates physics-based priors to enhance the feature extraction and representation capabilities. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and detection precision.

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

This paper introduces Deconver, a novel network that integrates traditional deconvolution techniques from image restoration as a core learnable component within a U-shaped architecture. Deconver replaces computationally expensive attention mechanisms with efficient nonnegative deconvolution (NDC) operations, enabling the restoration of high-frequency details while suppressing artifacts. Key innovations include a backpropagation-friendly NDC layer based on a provably monotonic update rule and a parameter-efficient design. Evaluated across four datasets (ISLES'22, BraTS'23, GlaS, FIVES) covering both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks, Deconver achieves state-of-the-art performance in Dice scores and Hausdorff distance while reducing computational costs (FLOPs) by up to 90% compared to leading baselines. By bridging traditional image restoration with deep learning, this work offers a practical solution for high-precision segmentation in resource-constrained clinical workflows.

In this work, we propose a new framework, namely InstructRestore, to perform region-adjustable image restoration following human instructions. To achieve this, we first develop a data generation engine to produce training triplets, each consisting of a high-quality image, the target region description, and the corresponding region mask. With this engine and careful data screening, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 536,945 triplets to support the training and evaluation of this task. We then examine how to integrate the low-quality image features under the ControlNet architecture to adjust the degree of image details enhancement. Consequently, we develop a ControlNet-like model to identify the target region and allocate different integration scales to the target and surrounding regions, enabling region-customized image restoration that aligns with user instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstructRestore approach enables effective human-instructed image restoration, such as images with bokeh effects and user-instructed local enhancement. Our work advances the investigation of interactive image restoration and enhancement techniques.

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets. We will release all sources under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the Regularization by Denoising principle, we introduce an approach that integrates a Latent Diffusion Model, trained for the denoising task, into a variational framework using Half-Quadratic Splitting, exploiting its regularization properties. This approach, under appropriate conditions that can be easily met in various imaging applications, allows for reduced computational cost while achieving high-quality results. The proposed strategy, called Regularization by Latent Denoising (RELD), is then tested on a dataset of natural images, for image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks. The numerical experiments show that RELD is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly achieving remarkable results when evaluated using perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

Pre-trained diffusion models have been very successfully used as image priors in zero-shot image restoration methods. However, how to best handle the degradation operator is still an open problem. In real-world data, methods that rely on specific parametric assumptions about the degradation model often face limitations in their applicability. To address this, we introduce Invert2Restore, a zero-shot, training-free method that operates in both fully blind and partially blind settings -- requiring no prior knowledge of the degradation model or only partial knowledge of its parametric form without known parameters. Despite this, Invert2Restore achieves high-fidelity results and generalizes well across various types of image degradation. It leverages a pre-trained diffusion model as a deterministic mapping between normal samples and undistorted image samples. The key insight is that the input noise mapped by a diffusion model to a degraded image lies in a low-probability density region of the standard normal distribution. Thus, we can restore the degraded image by carefully guiding its input noise toward a higher-density region. We experimentally validate Invert2Restore across several image restoration tasks, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in scenarios where the degradation operator is either unknown or partially known.</p></details> |  |

These methods typically require at least a parametric form of the degradation model. However, in real-world scenarios, the degradation may be too complex to define explicitly. To handle this general case, we introduce the Diffusion Image Prior (DIIP). We take inspiration from the Deep Image Prior (DIP)[16], since it can be used to remove artifacts without the need for an explicit degradation model. However, in contrast to DIP, we find that pretrained diffusion models offer a much stronger prior, despite being trained without knowledge from corrupted data. We show that, the optimization process in DIIP first reconstructs a clean version of the image before eventually overfitting to the degraded input, but it does so for a broader range of degradations than DIP. In light of this result, we propose a blind image restoration (IR) method based on early stopping, which does not require prior knowledge of the degradation model. We validate DIIP on various degradation-blind IR tasks, including JPEG artifact removal, waterdrop removal, denoising and super-resolution with state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In MHA, heads perform attention calculation independently from uniform split subspaces, and a redundancy issue is triggered to hinder the model from achieving satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose to improve MHA by exploring diverse learners and introducing various interactions between heads, which results in a Hierarchical multI-head atteNtion driven Transformer model, termed HINT, for image restoration. HINT contains two modules, i.e., the Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention (HMHA) and the Query-Key Cache Updating (QKCU) module, to address the redundancy problem that is rooted in vanilla MHA. Specifically, HMHA extracts diverse contextual features by employing heads to learn from subspaces of varying sizes and containing different information. Moreover, QKCU, comprising intra- and inter-layer schemes, further reduces the redundancy problem by facilitating enhanced interactions between attention heads within and across layers. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 benchmarks across 5 image restoration tasks, including low-light enhancement, dehazing, desnowing, denoising, and deraining, to demonstrate the superiority of HINT.

Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\times$ super-resolution and severe noise. Importantly, our framework works with any image restoration diffusion model, providing a versatile solution for video enhancement without task-specific training or modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web/</p></details> |

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

In this paper, we propose Fractal-IR, a fractal-based design that progressively refines degraded images by repeatedly expanding local information into broader regions. This fractal architecture naturally captures local details at early stages and seamlessly transitions toward global context in deeper fractal stages, removing the need for computationally heavy long-range self-attention mechanisms. Moveover, we observe the challenge in scaling up vision transformers for IR tasks. Through a series of analyses, we identify a holistic set of strategies to effectively guide model scaling. Extensive experimental results show that Fractal-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, denoising, JPEG artifact removal, IR in adverse weather conditions, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and demosaicking. For $2\times$ SR on Manga109, Fractal-IR achieves a 0.21 dB PSNR gain.

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing.

To address this issue, we propose the Vision-Language-guided Unfolding Network (VLU-Net), a unified DUN framework for handling multiple degradation types simultaneously. VLU-Net leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) refined on degraded image-text pairs to align image features with degradation descriptions, selecting the appropriate transform for target degradation.

Furthermore, we design a hierarchical feature unfolding structure to enhance VLU-Net framework, efficiently synthesizing degradation patterns across various levels. VLU-Net is the first all-in-one DUN framework and outperforms current leading one-by-one and all-in-one end-to-end methods by 3.74 dB on the SOTS dehazing dataset and 1.70 dB on the Rain100L deraining dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed.

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |

However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

Specifically, PPTformer contains two parts: an Image Restoration Network (IRNet) for restoring images from degraded observations and a Parser-Prompted Feature Generation Network (PPFGNet) for providing IRNet with reliable parser information to boost restoration. To enhance the integration of the parser within IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter Parser-Prompted Attention (InterPPA) to implicitly and explicitly learn useful parser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross attention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception of the parser from a long-range and intra-layer perspective. Conversely, the InterPPA initially fuses restoration features with those of the parser, followed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to explicitly perceive parser information. Further, we propose a parser-prompted feed-forward network to guide restoration within pixel-wise gating modulation. Experimental results show that PPTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image deraining, defocus deblurring, desnowing, and low-light enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is accepted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS.

To cope with these challenges, we analyze the restoration process in depth through a progressive spectral perspective, and deconstruct the complex UHD restoration problem into three progressive stages: zero-frequency enhancement, low-frequency restoration, and high-frequency refinement. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, ERR, which comprises three collaborative sub-networks: the zero-frequency enhancer (ZFE), the low-frequency restorer (LFR), and the high-frequency refiner (HFR). Specifically, the ZFE integrates global priors to learn global mapping, while the LFR restores low-frequency information, emphasizing reconstruction of coarse-grained content. Finally, the HFR employs our designed frequency-windowed kolmogorov-arnold networks (FW-KAN) to refine textures and details, producing high-quality image restoration. Our approach significantly outperforms previous UHD methods across various tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we introduce ABAIR, a simple yet effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration model that not only handles multiple degradations and generalizes well to unseen distortions but also efficiently integrates new degradations by training only a small subset of parameters. We first train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations. To enhance its ability to recognize distortions, we incorporate a segmentation head that estimates per-pixel degradation types. Second, we adapt our initial model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. This specialize-then-merge approach is both powerful in addressing specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks. Moreover, our model not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance on five- and three-task IR setups but also demonstrates superior generalization to unseen degradations and composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system.

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional scanners achieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then merging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue defocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to restore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes. However, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate defocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic complexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution cascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in preserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly propose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial prompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that describe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the fine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by feeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology images from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture of prompts to clinical usage.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity.

This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

However, extending these approaches to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is challenging due to the domain gap between RGB and HSI features, information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation patterns via text prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies.

| **[Boosting Diffusion-Based Text Image Super-Resolution Model Towards Generalized Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07232v2)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.07232v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring low-resolution text images presents a significant challenge, as it requires maintaining both the fidelity and stylistic realism of the text in restored images. Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mrluin/UniRestorer.</p></details> | 30 pages, 20 figures |

Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches struggle with addressing complex and ambiguously defined degradation types. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic degradation decomposition network for all-in-one image restoration, named D$^3$Net. D$^3$Net achieves degradation-adaptive image restoration with guided prompt through cross-domain interaction and dynamic degradation decomposition. Concretely, in D$^3$Net, the proposed Cross-Domain Degradation Analyzer (CDDA) engages in deep interaction between frequency domain degradation characteristics and spatial domain image features to identify and model variations of different degradation types on the image manifold, generating degradation correction prompt and strategy prompt, which guide the following decomposition process. Furthermore, the prompt-based Dynamic Decomposition Mechanism (DDM) for progressive degradation decomposition, that encourages the network to adaptively select restoration strategies utilizing the two-level prompt generated by CDDA. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation between CDDA and DDM, D$^3$Net achieves superior flexibility and scalability in handling unknown degradation, while effectively reducing unnecessary computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks demonstrate that D$^3$Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially improving PSNR by 5.47dB and 3.30dB on the SOTS-Outdoor and GoPro datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation reveals a critical gap: existing approaches consistently fail on severely degraded videos--precisely where diffusion models' generative capabilities are most needed. We identify that existing diffusion-based VSR methods struggle primarily because they face an overwhelming learning burden: simultaneously modeling complex degradation distributions, content representations, and temporal relationships with limited high-quality training data. To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos. Our work reveals that addressing the learning strategy, rather than focusing solely on architectural complexity, is the critical path toward robust real-world video super-resolution with diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xh9998.github.io/DiffVSR-project/</p></details> |

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, this enhanced contrast comes at the cost of system complexity, constrained by an inherent trade-off between spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we present a deep learning-based approach that restores and enhances pixel resolution post-acquisition without any a priori knowledge. Fine-tuned using metrics aligned with the imaging model, our physics-aware method achieves a 16X pixel super-resolution enhancement and a 12X imaging speedup without the need of additional training data for transfer learning. Applied to both synthetic and experimental data from five different sample types, we demonstrate that the model preserves biological integrity, ensuring no features are lost or hallucinated. We also concretely demonstrate the model's ability to reveal disease-associated metabolic changes in Downs syndrome that would otherwise remain undetectable. Furthermore, we provide physical insights into the inner workings of the model, paving the way for future refinements that could potentially surpass instrumental limits in an explainable manner. All methods are available as open-source software on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Most existing deweathering methods rely on increasing the network scale and data volume to achieve better performance which requires more expensive computing power. Also, many methods lack generalization for specific applications. In the traffic surveillance screener, the main challenges are snow removal and veil effect elimination. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods. Our approach also demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy when applied to real traffic surveillance images.</p></details> |  |

More recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach, which utilizes a pre-trained \textit{generative diffusion model}, has gained great popularity for solving IR problems through stochastic sampling. The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity. The unsatisfactory results are due to the lack of integration of these strategies in the IR tasks. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot IR scheme, dubbed Reconciling Diffusion Model in Dual (RDMD), which leverages only a \textbf{single} pre-trained diffusion model to construct \textbf{two} complementary regularizers. Specifically, the diffusion model in RDMD will iteratively perform deterministic denoising and stochastic sampling, aiming to achieve high-fidelity image restoration with appealing perceptual quality. RDMD also allows users to customize the distortion-perception tradeoff with a single hyperparameter, enhancing the adaptability of the restoration process in different practical scenarios.

However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization.

In this paper, we propose a relatively lightweight Adapter that leverages the powerful generative capabilities of pretrained priors to achieve photo-realistic image restoration. The Adapters can be adapt to both denoising UNet and DiT, and performs excellent.</p></details> |  |

However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance towards diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios. Our code and data are accessible through https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiffTOD.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious, realistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose OSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically, we propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior information and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are processed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a vector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we incorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further ensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the restored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that OSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images with high identity consistency.

In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning.

Addressing this challenge requires methods that systematically explore skill combinations to uncover task-solving sequences, harness generic, easy-to-learn skills (e.g., pushing, grasping) to generalize across unseen tasks, and bypass reliance on symbolic world representations that demand extensive domain and task-specific knowledge. Despite significant progress, these elements remain largely disjoint in existing approaches, leaving a critical gap in achieving robust, scalable solutions for complex, long-horizon problems. In this work, we present MOSAIC, a skill-centric framework that unifies these elements by using the skills themselves to guide the planning process. MOSAIC uses two families of skills: Generators compute executable trajectories and world configurations, and Connectors link these independently generated skill trajectories by solving boundary value problems, enabling progress toward completing the overall task. By breaking away from the conventional paradigm of incrementally discovering skills from predefined start or goal states--a limitation that significantly restricts exploration--MOSAIC focuses planning efforts on regions where skills are inherently effective. We demonstrate the efficacy of MOSAIC in both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, showcasing its ability to solve complex long-horizon planning problems using a diverse set of skills incorporating generative diffusion models, motion planning algorithms, and manipulation-specific models.

Some studies show that the aesthetic properties of images are highly positively correlated with human perception of image quality. Inspired by this, we approach the problem from a novel and intriguing aesthetic perspective to degrade the generation quality of maliciously customized models, thereby achieving better protection of facial identity. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anti-Aesthetic (HAA) framework to fully explore aesthetic cues, which consists of two key branches: 1) Global Anti-Aesthetics: By establishing a global anti-aesthetic reward mechanism and a global anti-aesthetic loss, it can degrade the overall aesthetics of the generated content; 2) Local Anti-Aesthetics: A local anti-aesthetic reward mechanism and a local anti-aesthetic loss are designed to guide adversarial perturbations to disrupt local facial identity. By seamlessly integrating both branches, our HAA effectively achieves the goal of anti-aesthetics from a global to a local level during customized generation. Extensive experiments show that HAA outperforms existing SOTA methods largely in identity removal, providing a powerful tool for protecting facial privacy and copyright.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the submission of the paper, we realized that the study still has room for expansion.

HandDiffuse12.5M has the largest scale and richest interactions among the existing two-hand datasets. We further present a strong baseline method HandDiffuse for the controllable motion generation of interacting hands using various controllers. Specifically, we apply the diffusion model as the backbone and design two motion representations for different controllers. To reduce artifacts, we also propose Interaction Loss which explicitly quantifies the dynamic interaction process. Our HandDiffuse enables various applications with vivid two-hand interactions, i.e., motion in-betweening and trajectory control. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in motion generation and can also contribute to data augmentation for other datasets. Our dataset, corresponding codes, and pre-trained models will be disseminated to the community for future research towards two-hand interaction modeling.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework that emphasizes efficient and cooperative deployment. The proposed method restructures the GDM inference process by allowing users with semantically similar prompts to share parts of the denoising chain. Furthermore, to maximize the users' subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach, i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI), which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to replicate user interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback aligned with diverse user personalities. Lastly, we present the GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDDPG) algorithm, adapted to the proposed RLLI framework, to allocate communication and computing resources effectively while accounting for subjective user traits and dynamic wireless conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that G-DDPG improves total QoE by 15% compared with the standard DDPG algorithm.</p></details> |  |

While multi-stage pipelines or diffusion models yield high-quality results, they suffer from high computational costs. Some approaches perform well on specific individuals with low resources, yet still exhibit mismatched lip movements. The aforementioned methods are modeled in the pixel domain. We observed that there are noticeable discrepancies in the frequency domain between the synthesized talking videos and natural videos. Currently, no research on talking portrait synthesis has considered this aspect. To address this, we propose a FREquency-modulated, high-fidelity, and real-time Audio-driven talKing portrait synthesis framework, named FREAK, which models talking portraits from the frequency domain perspective, enhancing the fidelity and naturalness of the synthesized portraits. FREAK introduces two novel frequency-based modules: 1) the Visual Encoding Frequency Modulator (VEFM) to couple multi-scale visual features in the frequency domain, better preserving visual frequency information and reducing the gap in the frequency spectrum between synthesized and natural frames. and 2) the Audio Visual Frequency Modulator (AVFM) to help the model learn the talking pattern in the frequency domain and improve audio-visual synchronization. Additionally, we optimize the model in both pixel domain and frequency domain jointly. Furthermore, FREAK supports seamless switching between one-shot and video dubbing settings, offering enhanced flexibility. Due to its superior performance, it can simultaneously support high-resolution video results and real-time inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method synthesizes high-fidelity talking portraits with detailed facial textures and precise lip synchronization in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> |

Building on the work of Toker et al.

To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions.

Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming-a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods suffer from poor controllability, making them less applicable to real-world scenarios such as filmmaking and live streaming for e-commerce. To address this limitation, we propose FLAP, a novel approach that integrates explicit 3D intermediate parameters (head poses and facial expressions) into the diffusion model for end-to-end generation of realistic portrait videos. The proposed architecture allows the model to generate vivid portrait videos from audio while simultaneously incorporating additional control signals, such as head rotation angles and eye-blinking frequency. Furthermore, the decoupling of head pose and facial expression allows for independent control of each, offering precise manipulation of both the avatar's pose and facial expressions. We also demonstrate its flexibility in integrating with existing 3D head generation methods, bridging the gap between 3D model-based approaches and end-to-end diffusion techniques. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait video models in both naturalness and controllability.</p></details> |  |

However, its effective use in machine learning (ML) is often constrained by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging generative models to learn the distribution of real datasets and produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving samples. Various generative paradigms have been explored, including energy-based models (EBMs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models. While several surveys have investigated synthetic tabular data generation, most focus on narrow subdomains or specific generative methods, such as GANs, diffusion models, or privacy-preserving techniques. This limited scope often results in fragmented insights, lacking a comprehensive synthesis that bridges diverse approaches. In particular, recent advances driven by LLMs and diffusion-based models remain underexplored. This gap hinders a holistic understanding of the field`s evolution, methodological interplay, and open challenges. To address this, our survey provides a unified and systematic review of synthetic tabular data generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes existing methods into traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models, and provide an in-depth comparative analysis; (2) we detail the complete pipeline for synthetic tabular data generation, including data synthesis, post-processing, and evaluation; (3) we identify major challenges, explore real-world applications, and outline open research questions and future directions to guide future work in this rapidly evolving area.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, the accumulation of high-quality protein structure and sequence data and technological advancements have paved the way for the successful application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in protein design. These models have surpassed traditional approaches that rely on fragments and bioinformatics. They have significantly enhanced the success rate of de novo protein design, and reduced experimental costs, leading to breakthroughs in the field. Among various generative AI models, diffusion models have yielded the most promising results in protein design.

In this work, we present Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM), a novel and versatile objective for training and fine-tuning discrete diffusion models. TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports pre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many existing discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our more general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to post-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward functions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained autoregressive models. These new capabilities stem from the core idea of TCSM, estimating the concrete score of the target distribution, which resides in the original (clean) data space. This allows seamless integration with reward functions and pre-trained models, which inherently only operate in the clean data space rather than the noisy intermediate spaces of diffusion processes. Our experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM matches or surpasses current methods. Additionally, TCSM is versatile, applicable to both pre-training and post-training scenarios, offering greater flexibility and sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the typical face swapping training process, which often relies on implicit supervision and struggles to achieve satisfactory results. DreamID establishes explicit supervision for face swapping by constructing Triplet ID Group data, significantly enhancing identity similarity and attribute preservation. The iterative nature of diffusion models poses challenges for utilizing efficient image-space loss functions, as performing time-consuming multi-step sampling to obtain the generated image during training is impractical. To address this issue, we leverage the accelerated diffusion model SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps to a single iteration, enabling efficient pixel-level end-to-end training with explicit Triplet ID Group supervision. Additionally, we propose an improved diffusion-based model architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and ID Adapter. This robust architecture fully unlocks the power of the Triplet ID Group explicit supervision. Finally, to further extend our method, we explicitly modify the Triplet ID Group data during training to fine-tune and preserve specific attributes, such as glasses and face shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity similarity, pose and expression preservation, and image fidelity. Overall, DreamID achieves high-quality face swapping results at 512*512 resolution in just 0.6 seconds and performs exceptionally well in challenging scenarios such as complex lighting, large angles, and occlusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://superhero-7.github.io/DreamID/</p></details> |

As diffusion models advance in generating highly realistic videos, the need for reliable content attribution mechanisms has become critical. While watermarking techniques for image diffusion models have made progress, directly extending these methods to videos presents unique challenges due to variable video lengths and vulnerability to temporal attacks. VideoMark addresses these limitations through a frame-wise watermarking strategy using pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes to embed watermark information during the generation process. Our method generates an extended watermark message sequence and randomly selects starting positions for each video, ensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space and maintaining generation quality. For watermark extraction, we introduce a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that uses edit distance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence, providing robustness against temporal attacks such as frame deletion. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while maintaining video quality on par with watermark-free generation. Importantly, our watermark remains undetectable to attackers without the secret key, ensuring strong imperceptibility compared to other watermarking frameworks. VideoMark provides a practical solution for content attribution in diffusion-based video generation without requiring additional training or compromising video quality.

The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention for assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same glossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are employed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign recognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple human activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss component based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track pose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information sources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a Video2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer pose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign language recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying the foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition. Experimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language video, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has been reported in prior work.</p></details> |  |

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  |

However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework.

Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction sequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their representations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific intents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for beauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise, disrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction sequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may mislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding space and failing to capture users' true behavior patterns and intents. To address these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive learning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate item sequences aligned with users' purchasing intents, thus providing more reliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first performs intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build intent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the target interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating positive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive learning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these intent-aligned views and the original sequence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that InDiRec achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, learning more robust representations even under noisy and sparse data conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

By inserting small, learnable modules into pretrained diffusion models, these adapters can maintain temporal coherence without extensive retraining. Approaches that incorporate prompt learning with both shared and frame-specific tokens are particularly effective in preserving continuity across frames at low training cost. In this work, we want to provide a general theoretical framework for adapters that maintain frame consistency in DDIM-based models under a temporal consistency loss. First, we prove that the temporal consistency objective is differentiable under bounded feature norms, and we establish a Lipschitz bound on its gradient. Second, we show that gradient descent on this objective decreases the loss monotonically and converges to a local minimum if the learning rate is within an appropriate range. Finally, we analyze the stability of modules in the DDIM inversion procedure, showing that the associated error remains controlled. These theoretical findings will reinforce the reliability of diffusion-based video editing methods that rely on adapter strategies and provide theoretical insights in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.04606</p></details> |

As Sixth-Generation (6G) communication networks pursue full-scenario coverage, optimization in complex extreme environments presents unprecedented challenges. The dynamic nature of these environments, combined with physical constraints, makes it difficult for AI solutions such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to obtain effective reward feedback for the training process. However, many existing DRL-based network optimization studies overlook this challenge through idealized environment settings. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI), especially diffusion models, in capturing complex latent distributions, we introduce a novel Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping Scheme (DRESS) to achieve robust network optimization. By conditioning on observed environmental states and executed actions, DRESS leverages diffusion models' multi-step denoising process as a form of deep reasoning, progressively refining latent representations to generate meaningful auxiliary reward signals that capture patterns of network systems. Moreover, DRESS is designed for seamless integration with any DRL framework, allowing DRESS-aided DRL (DRESSed-DRL) to enable stable and efficient DRL training even under extreme network environments. Experimental results demonstrate that DRESSed-DRL achieves about 1.5x times faster convergence than its original version in sparse-reward wireless environments and significant performance improvements in multiple general DRL benchmark environments compared to baseline methods.

There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs but also require more computing resources and processing time, which impacts overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information, further enhancing the framework's performance. Experimental results with long prompt tokens demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, significantly reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate this threat and present a novel attack on autoregressive diffusion models, such as those used in GenCast, capable of manipulating weather forecasts and fabricating extreme events, including hurricanes, heat waves, and intense rainfall. The attack introduces subtle perturbations into weather observations that are statistically indistinguishable from natural noise and change less than 0.1% of the measurements - comparable to tampering with data from a single meteorological satellite.

However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Current text-to-3D generation methods typically combine parametric head models with 2D diffusion models using score distillation sampling to produce 3D-consistent results. However, they struggle to synthesize realistic details and suffer from misalignments between the appearance and the driving parametric model, resulting in unnatural animation results. We discovered that these limitations stem from ambiguities in the 2D diffusion predictions during 3D avatar distillation, specifically: i) the avatar's appearance and geometry is underconstrained by the text input, and ii) the semantic alignment between the predictions and the parametric head model is insufficient because the diffusion model alone cannot incorporate information from the parametric model. In this work, we propose a novel framework, AnimPortrait3D, for text-based realistic animatable 3DGS avatar generation with morphable model alignment, and introduce two key strategies to address these challenges. First, we tackle appearance and geometry ambiguities by utilizing prior information from a pretrained text-to-3D model to initialize a 3D avatar with robust appearance, geometry, and rigging relationships to the morphable model. Second, we refine the initial 3D avatar for dynamic expressions using a ControlNet that is conditioned on semantic and normal maps of the morphable model to ensure accurate alignment. As a result, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of synthesis quality, alignment, and animation fidelity. Our experiments show that the proposed method advances the state of the art in text-based, animatable 3D head avatar generation.</p></details> |  |

Methods based on synthetic data are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data but require a high degree of realism and controllability in order to be useful. This paper introduces MObI, a novel framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to create realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated for both camera and lidar simultaneously. Using a single reference RGB image, MObI enables objects to be seamlessly inserted into existing multimodal scenes at a 3D location specified by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, our 3D bounding box conditioning gives objects accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. As a result, our approach can be used to insert novel objects flexibly into multimodal scenes, providing significant advantages for testing perception models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; Project page at https://alexbubu.com/mobi</p></details> |

Previous efforts mainly concentrated on single-view generation, often resulting in inconsistencies across neighboring ground views. In this work, we propose a novel cross-view synthesis approach designed to overcome these challenges by ensuring consistency across ground-view images generated from satellite views. Our method, based on a fixed latent diffusion model, introduces two conditioning modules: satellite-guided denoising, which extracts high-level scene layout to guide the denoising process, and satellite-temporal denoising, which captures camera motion to maintain consistency across multiple generated views. We further contribute a large-scale satellite-ground dataset containing over 100,000 perspective pairs to facilitate extensive ground scene or video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on perceptual and temporal metrics, achieving high photorealism and consistency in multi-view outputs.</p></details> | 8 figures |

Our method leverages diffusion inversion and timestep-specific null-text embeddings to preserve the structural integrity of the source image. By introducing a stage-wise latent injection strategy-shape injection in early steps and attribute injection in later steps-we enable precise, fine-grained modifications while maintaining global consistency. Cross-attention with reference latents facilitates semantic alignment between the source and reference. Extensive experiments across expression transfer, texture transformation, and style infusion demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, confirming the method's scalability and adaptability to diverse image editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Guidance of Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02150v2)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.02150v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has shown state-of-the-art performance in various generative tasks, ranging from image generation to decision-making, where guided generation is pivotal. However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework.

In maximum entropy sampling, one selects measurement locations that are expected to have the highest entropy, so as to minimize uncertainty about $x$. This approach relies on an accurate model of the posterior distribution over future measurements, given the measurements observed so far. Recently, diffusion models have been shown to produce high-quality posterior samples of high-dimensional signals using guided diffusion. In this work, we propose Active Diffusion Subsampling (ADS), a method for designing intelligent subsampling masks using guided diffusion in which the model tracks a distribution of beliefs over the true state of $x$ throughout the reverse diffusion process, progressively decreasing its uncertainty by actively choosing to acquire measurements with maximum expected entropy, ultimately producing the posterior distribution $p(x \mid y)$. ADS can be applied using pre-trained diffusion models for any subsampling rate, and does not require task-specific retraining - just the specification of a measurement model. Furthermore, the maximum entropy sampling policy employed by ADS is interpretable, enhancing transparency relative to existing methods using black-box policies.

While existing jailbreak studies primarily focus on VLMs' susceptibility to harmful instructions, we reveal a fundamental yet overlooked vulnerability: toxic text continuation, where VLMs produce highly toxic completions when prompted with harmful text prefixes paired with semantically adversarial images. To systematically study this threat, we propose Red Team Diffuser (RTD), the first red teaming diffusion model that coordinates adversarial image generation and toxic continuation through reinforcement learning. Our key innovations include dynamic cross-modal attack and stealth-aware optimization. For toxic text prefixes from an LLM safety benchmark, we conduct greedy search to identify optimal image prompts that maximally induce toxic completions. The discovered image prompts then drive RL-based diffusion model fine-tuning, producing semantically aligned adversarial images that boost toxicity rates. Stealth-aware optimization introduces joint adversarial rewards that balance toxicity maximization (via Detoxify classifier) and stealthiness (via BERTScore), circumventing traditional noise-based adversarial patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RTD, increasing the toxicity rate of LLaVA outputs by 10.69% over text-only baselines on the original attack set and 8.91% on an unseen set, proving generalization capability. Moreover, RTD exhibits strong cross-model transferability, raising the toxicity rate by 5.1% on Gemini and 26.83% on LLaMA. Our findings expose two critical flaws in current VLM alignment: (1) failure to prevent toxic continuation from harmful prefixes, and (2) overlooking cross-modal attack vectors. These results necessitate a paradigm shift toward multimodal red teaming in safety evaluations.</p></details> |  |

As wireless communication evolves towards environment-aware paradigms, driven by the increasing demand for intelligent and proactive optimization in sixth-generation (6G) networks, accurate construction of RMs becomes crucial yet highly challenging. Conventional electromagnetic (EM)-based methods, such as full-wave solvers and ray-tracing approaches, exhibit substantial computational overhead and limited adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Although, existing neural network (NN) approaches have efficient inferencing speed, they lack sufficient consideration of the underlying physics of EM wave propagation, limiting their effectiveness in accurately modeling critical EM singularities induced by complex multipath environments. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel physics-inspired RM construction method guided explicitly by the Helmholtz equation, which inherently governs EM wave propagation. Specifically, we theoretically establish a direct correspondence between EM singularities, which correspond to the critical spatial features influencing wireless propagation, and regions defined by negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation. Based on this insight, we design an innovative dual generative diffusion model (DM) framework comprising one DM dedicated to accurately inferring EM singularities and another DM responsible for reconstructing the complete RM using these singularities along with environmental contextual information. Our physics-informed approach uniquely combines the efficiency advantages of data-driven methods with rigorous physics-based EM modeling, significantly enhancing RM accuracy, particularly in complex propagation environments dominated by multipath effects.</p></details> |  |

However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR).

Recent advancements have positioned diffusion models as effective MDE tools by framing the challenge as a conditional image generation task. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle with accurately reconstructing distant depths, due largely to the imbalanced distribution of depth values and an over-reliance on spatial-domain features. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework that integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature enhancements with an adaptive weight-balancing mechanism into the diffusion process. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, thereby improving the preservation of structural details and reducing noisy artifacts. Furthermore, we implement an adaptive weighting strategy that modulates the diffusion loss in real-time, enhancing the model's sensitivity towards distant depth reconstruction. These innovations collectively result in superior depth perception performance across both distance and detail. Experimental evaluations confirm that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion-based MDE techniques, particularly excelling in the accurate reconstruction of distant regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Recent diffusion-based methods yield promising outcomes but necessitate prolonged and computationally intensive iterative sampling. In response, we propose InstaRevive, a straightforward yet powerful image enhancement framework that employs score-based diffusion distillation to harness potent generative capability and minimize the sampling steps. To fully exploit the potential of the pre-trained diffusion model, we devise a practical and effective diffusion distillation pipeline using dynamic control to address inaccuracies in updating direction during score matching. Our control strategy enables a dynamic diffusing scope, facilitating precise learning of denoising trajectories within the diffusion model and ensuring accurate distribution matching gradients during training. Additionally, to enrich guidance for the generative power, we incorporate textual prompts via image captioning as auxiliary conditions, fostering further exploration of the diffusion model. Extensive experiments substantiate the efficacy of our framework across a diverse array of challenging tasks and datasets, unveiling the compelling efficacy and efficiency of InstaRevive in delivering high-quality and visually appealing results.

Firstly, we extend the Ambient Diffusion framework to enable training directly from measurements corrupted in the Fourier domain. Subsequently, we train diffusion models for MRI with access only to Fourier subsampled multi-coil measurements at acceleration factors R= 2,4,6,8. Secondly, we propose Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a reconstruction algorithm that leverages generative models pre-trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) to perform posterior sampling on measurements from a different forward process (e.g. image blurring). For MRI reconstruction in high acceleration regimes, we observe that A-DPS models trained on subsampled data are better suited to solving inverse problems than models trained on fully sampled data. We also test the efficacy of A-DPS on natural image datasets (CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ) and show that A-DPS can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for several image restoration tasks in both speed and performance.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 32 figures, preliminary version</p></details> |

Despite extensive research in the (semi-)supervised regime, zero-shot and few-shot solutions have only recently emerged as promising alternatives. Their main advantage is in alleviating the ongoing data maintenance, which quickly becomes outdated due to advances in generative technologies. We identify two main gaps: (1) a lack of theoretical grounding for the methods, and (2) significant room for performance improvements in zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Our approach is founded on understanding and quantifying the biases inherent in generated content, where we use these quantities as criteria for characterizing generated images. Specifically, we explore the biases of the implicit probability manifold, captured by a pre-trained diffusion model. Through score-function analysis, we approximate the curvature, gradient, and bias towards points on the probability manifold, establishing criteria for detection in the zero-shot regime. We further extend our contribution to the few-shot setting by employing a mixture-of-experts methodology. Empirical results across 20 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Undetectability ensures that no efficient adversary can distinguish between watermarked and un-watermarked images, even after making many adaptive queries. In particular, an undetectable watermark does not degrade image quality under any efficiently computable metric. Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to every prior scheme we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks.

In this work, we address the challenge of generating photorealistic mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative models. Despite extensive training data, existing diffusion models frequently overlook the nuanced details crucial to authentic mirror reflections. Recent approaches have attempted to resolve this by creating synhetic datasets and framing reflection generation as an inpainting task; however, they struggle to generalize across different object orientations and positions relative to the mirror. Our method overcomes these limitations by introducing key augmentations into the synthetic data pipeline: (1) random object positioning, (2) randomized rotations, and (3) grounding of objects, significantly enhancing generalization across poses and placements. To further address spatial relationships and occlusions in scenes with multiple objects, we implement a strategy to pair objects during dataset generation, resulting in a dataset robust enough to handle these complex scenarios. Achieving generalization to real-world scenes remains a challenge, so we introduce a three-stage training curriculum to develop the MirrorFusion 2.0 model to improve real-world performance.

Existing methods lack a systematic way to reliably extract the interpretable underlying intrinsic concepts. To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilises a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements.

This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a method we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and softmax-based sampling.

However, its availability is often hindered by the requirements of data capturing devices, manual labor, and suitable actors. This situation restricts the diversity, expressiveness, and control over the resulting models. This work aims to demonstrate that a semantically controllable generative network can provide enhanced control over the digital face modeling process. To enhance diversity beyond the limited human faces scanned in a controlled setting, we introduce a novel data generation pipeline that creates a high-quality 3D face database using a pre-trained diffusion model. Our proposed normalization module converts synthesized data from the diffusion model into high-quality scanned data. Using the 44,000 face models we obtained, we further developed an efficient GAN-based generator. This generator accepts semantic attributes as input, and generates geometry and albedo. It also allows continuous post-editing of attributes in the latent space. Our asset refinement component subsequently creates physically-based facial assets. We introduce a comprehensive system designed for creating and editing high-quality face assets. Our proposed model has undergone extensive experiment, comparison and evaluation. We also integrate everything into a web-based interactive tool. We aim to make this tool publicly available with the release of the paper.</p></details> |  |

It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web.</p></details> |  |

However, generating diverse customized images with reference visual attributes remains challenging. This work focuses on personalizing T2I diffusion models at a more abstract concept or category level, adapting commonalities from a set of reference images while creating new instances with sufficient variations. We introduce a solution that allows a pretrained T2I diffusion model to learn a set of soft prompts, enabling the generation of novel images by sampling prompts from the learned distribution. These prompts offer text-guided editing capabilities and additional flexibility in controlling variation and mixing between multiple distributions. We also show the adaptability of the learned prompt distribution to other tasks, such as text-to-3D. Finally we demonstrate effectiveness of our approach through quantitative analysis including automatic evaluation and human assessment.

While recent advances have shown promising results in 4D avatar creation, existing methods either require extensive multiview data or struggle with shape accuracy and identity consistency. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive system that leverages shape, image, and video priors to create full-view, animatable avatars. Our approach first obtains initial coarse shape through 3D-GAN inversion. Then, it enhances multiview textures using depth-guided warping signals for cross-view consistency with the help of the image diffusion model. To handle expression animation, we incorporate a video prior with synchronized driving signals across viewpoints. We further introduce a Consistent-Inconsistent training to effectively handle data inconsistencies during 4D reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior quality compared to the prior art, while maintaining consistency across different viewpoints and expressions.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we are the first to introduce human preference alignment into Real-ISR, a technique that has been successfully applied in Large Language Models and Text-to-Image tasks to effectively enhance the alignment of generated outputs with human preferences. Specifically, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into Real-ISR to achieve alignment, where DPO serves as a general alignment technique that directly learns from the human preference dataset. Nevertheless, unlike high-level tasks, the pixel-level reconstruction objectives of Real-ISR are difficult to reconcile with the image-level preferences of DPO, which can lead to the DPO being overly sensitive to local anomalies, leading to reduced generation quality. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Direct Semantic Preference Optimization (DSPO) to align instance-level human preferences by incorporating semantic guidance, which is through two strategies: (a) semantic instance alignment strategy, implementing instance-level alignment to ensure fine-grained perceptual consistency, and (b) user description feedback strategy, mitigating hallucinations through semantic textual feedback on instance-level images. As a plug-and-play solution, DSPO proves highly effective in both one-step and multi-step SR frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

This paper presents a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to automate and scale up aerobatic trajectory generation. Our key innovation is the decomposition of complex maneuvers into aerobatic primitives, which are short frame sequences that act as building blocks, featuring critical aerobatic behaviors for tractable trajectory synthesis. The model learns aerobatic primitives using historical trajectory observations as dynamic priors to ensure motion continuity, with additional conditional inputs (target waypoints and optional action constraints) integrated to enable user-editable trajectory generation. During model inference, classifier guidance is incorporated with batch sampling to achieve obstacle avoidance. Additionally, the generated outcomes are refined through post-processing with spatial-temporal trajectory optimization to ensure dynamical feasibility. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have validated the key component designs of our method, demonstrating its feasibility for deploying on real drones to achieve long-horizon aerobatic flight.</p></details> |  |

We then examine their interrelation, followed by an analysis of the limitations of conventional beamforming methods. Next, we provide an overview of how GenAI methods enhance the process of beamforming, with a focus on its applications in LAE. Furthermore, we present a case study using a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based algorithm to enhance the performance of aerial collaborative beamforming-enabled remote secure communications in LAE and simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Although existing generative watermarking techniques have proposed corresponding solutions, most methods require substantial computational overhead and training costs. In addition, some methods have limitations in robustness when handling variable-length inputs. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textsc{SOLIDO}, a novel generative watermarking method that integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning with speech watermarking through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for speech diffusion models. Concretely, the watermark encoder converts the watermark to align with the input of diffusion models. To achieve precise watermark extraction from variable-length inputs, the watermark decoder based on depthwise separable convolution is designed for watermark recovery. To further enhance speech generation performance and watermark extraction capability, we propose a speech-driven lightweight fine-tuning strategy, which reduces computational overhead through LoRA. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method ensures high-fidelity watermarked speech even at a large capacity of 2000 bps. Furthermore, against common individual and compound speech attacks, our SOLIDO achieves a maximum average extraction accuracy of 99.20\% and 98.43\%, respectively. It surpasses other state-of-the-art methods by nearly 23\% in resisting time-stretching attacks.</p></details> |  |

Conventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have difficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous, realistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions among individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain spatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map, appearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to crowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the timeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents' type, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd simulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it can augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall framework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by alternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the components in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose a benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated crowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level trajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models diverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different geographical environments.

One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

However, the models trained on synthetic datasets might have a degraded performance on practical particle images due to domain gaps. As a result, special residual patterns are often observed for the vector fields of deep learning-based estimators. To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ a denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the data-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer learning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1) pre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the computer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the pre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are upsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow structures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser effectively suppresses the noise patterns. Therefore, the denoising diffusion model reduces the average end-point error~($AEE$) by 59.4% over RAFT256-PIV baseline on the classic Cai's dataset. Besides, PIV-FlowDiffuser exhibits enhanced generalization performance on unseen particle images due to transfer learning. Overall, this study highlights the transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV. And a detailed implementation is recommended for interested readers in the repository https://github.com/Zhu-Qianyu/PIV-FlowDiffuser.</p></details> |  |

The FramePack compresses input frames to make the transformer context length a fixed number regardless of the video length. As a result, we are able to process a large number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack</p></details> |

Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, preprint</p></details> |

With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites.

Unlike recent point-based and flow-based affordance methods that focus on dense spatial representations or trajectory modeling, we propose A0, a hierarchical affordance-aware diffusion model that decomposes manipulation tasks into high-level spatial affordance understanding and low-level action execution. A0 leverages the Embodiment-Agnostic Affordance Representation, which captures object-centric spatial affordances by predicting contact points and post-contact trajectories. A0 is pre-trained on 1 million contact points data and fine-tuned on annotated trajectories, enabling generalization across platforms. Key components include Position Offset Attention for motion-aware feature extraction and a Spatial Information Aggregation Layer for precise coordinate mapping. The model's output is executed by the action execution module. Experiments on multiple robotic systems (Franka, Kinova, Realman, and Dobot) demonstrate A0's superior performance in complex tasks, showcasing its efficiency, flexibility, and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

ECG sensing is non-invasive and relatively easy to acquire, and yet it is still cumbersome for holter monitoring tests that may span over hours and even days. A possible alternative in this context is Photoplethysmography (PPG): An optically-based signal that measures blood volume fluctuations, as typically sensed by conventional ``wearable devices''. While PPG presents clear advantages in acquisition, convenience, and cost-effectiveness, ECG provides more comprehensive information, allowing for a more precise detection of heart conditions. This implies that a conversion from PPG to ECG, as recently discussed in the literature, inherently involves an unavoidable level of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for addressing the PPG-2-ECG conversion, and offer an enhanced classification of cardiovascular conditions using the given PPG, all while taking into account the uncertainties arising from the conversion process. We provide a mathematical justification for our proposed computational approach, and present empirical studies demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on spatial visual tokens, where image patches are encoded and arranged according to a spatial order (e.g., raster scan). However, we show that spatial tokens lack the recursive structure inherent to languages, hence form an impossible language for LLM to master. In this paper, we build a proper visual language by leveraging diffusion timesteps to learn discrete, recursive visual tokens. Our proposed tokens recursively compensate for the progressive attribute loss in noisy images as timesteps increase, enabling the diffusion model to reconstruct the original image at any timestep. This approach allows us to effectively integrate the strengths of LLMs in autoregressive reasoning and diffusion models in precise image generation, achieving seamless multimodal comprehension and generation within a unified framework. Extensive experiments show that we achieve superior performance for multimodal comprehension and generation simultaneously compared with other MLLMs. Project Page: https://DDT-LLaMA.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in recommendation for their ability to model complex distributions, yet current DM-based recommenders often rely on traditional objectives like mean squared error (MSE) or recommendation objectives, which are not optimized for personalized ranking tasks or fail to fully leverage DM's generative potential. To address this, we propose PreferDiff, a tailored optimization objective for DM-based recommenders. PreferDiff transforms BPR into a log-likelihood ranking objective and integrates multiple negative samples to better capture user preferences. Specifically, we employ variational inference to handle the intractability through minimizing the variational upper bound and replaces MSE with cosine error to improve alignment with recommendation tasks. Finally, we balance learning generation and preference to enhance the training stability of DMs. PreferDiff offers three key benefits: it is the first personalized ranking loss designed specifically for DM-based recommenders and it improves ranking and faster convergence by addressing hard negatives. We also prove that it is theoretically connected to Direct Preference Optimization which indicates that it has the potential to align user preferences in DM-based recommenders via generative modeling. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks validate its superior recommendation performance and commendable general sequential recommendation capabilities.

Timely disclosure and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in T2I models are crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models. We explore a novel training-free backdoor poisoning paradigm through model editing, which is recently employed for knowledge updating in large language models. Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\%.

Optical flow supervision is a promising approach to address this, with prior works commonly employing warping-based strategies that avoid explicit flow matching. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation, FlowLoss, which directly compares flow fields extracted from generated and ground-truth videos. To account for the unreliability of flow estimation under high-noise conditions in diffusion, we propose a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates the flow loss across denoising steps. Experiments on robotic video datasets suggest that FlowLoss improves motion stability and accelerates convergence in early training stages. Our findings offer practical insights for incorporating motion-based supervision into noise-conditioned generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach primarily minimizes the loss of mean squared error (MSE) at the pixel level, neglecting the need for global optimization at the image level, which is crucial for achieving high perceptual quality and structural coherence. In this paper, we introduce Self-sUpervised Direct preference Optimization (SUDO), a novel paradigm that optimizes both fine-grained details at the pixel level and global image quality. By integrating direct preference optimization into the model, SUDO generates preference image pairs in a self-supervised manner, enabling the model to prioritize global-level learning while complementing the pixel-level MSE loss. As an effective alternative to supervised fine-tuning, SUDO can be seamlessly applied to any text-to-image diffusion model. Importantly, it eliminates the need for costly data collection and annotation efforts typically associated with traditional direct preference optimization methods. Through extensive experiments on widely-used models, including Stable Diffusion 1.5 and XL, we demonstrate that SUDO significantly enhances both global and local image quality.

Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, generating high-quality 360-degree panoramic images and videos remains a challenging task due to the severe distortions introduced by equirectangular projection (ERP). Existing approaches either fine-tune pretrained diffusion models on limited ERP datasets or attempt tuning-free methods that still rely on ERP latent representations, leading to discontinuities near the poles. In this paper, we introduce SphereDiff, a novel approach for seamless 360-degree panoramic image and video generation using state-of-the-art diffusion models without additional tuning. We define a spherical latent representation that ensures uniform distribution across all perspectives, mitigating the distortions inherent in ERP. We extend MultiDiffusion to spherical latent space and propose a spherical latent sampling method to enable direct use of pretrained diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce distortion-aware weighted averaging to further improve the generation quality in the projection process. Our method outperforms existing approaches in generating 360-degree panoramic content while maintaining high fidelity, making it a robust solution for immersive AR/VR applications.

To achieve this, prior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent noise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the user-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM inversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from accurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content consistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel perspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency models that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence of content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the source frames. Moreover, we introduce a temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across the edited frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | accepted by cvpr2025 |

Driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents hold the potential to empower the creation, maintenance, and evolution of mobile metaverses. Currently, AI agents are primarily constructed using cloud-based LLMs and VLMs. However, several challenges hinder their effective implementation, including high service latency and potential sensitive data leakage during perception and processing. In this paper, we develop an edge-cloud collaboration-based federated AI agent construction framework in mobile metaverses. Specifically, Edge Servers (ESs), acting as agent infrastructures, collaboratively create agent modules in a distributed manner. The cloud server then integrates these modules into AI agents and deploys them at the edge, thereby enabling low-latency AI agent services for users. Considering that ESs may exhibit dynamic levels of willingness to participate in federated AI agent construction, we design a two-period dynamic contract model to continuously motivate ESs to participate in agent module creation, effectively addressing the dynamic information asymmetry between the cloud server and the ESs. Furthermore, we propose an Enhanced Diffusion Model-based Soft Actor-Critic (EDMSAC) algorithm to efficiently generate optimal dynamic contracts, in which dynamic structured pruning is applied to DM-based actor networks to enhance denoising efficiency and policy learning performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the EDMSAC algorithm and the proposed contract model.</p></details> |  |

Existing RM construction methods often rely on precise environmental data and base station (BS) locations, which are not always available in dynamic or privacy-sensitive environments. While sparse measurement techniques reduce data collection, the impact of noise in sparse data on RM accuracy is not well understood. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating RM construction as a Bayesian inverse problem under coarse environmental knowledge and noisy sparse measurements. Although maximum a posteriori (MAP) filtering offers an optimal solution, it requires a precise prior distribution of the RM, which is typically unavailable. To solve this, we propose RadioDiff-Inverse, a diffusion-enhanced Bayesian inverse estimation framework that uses an unconditional generative diffusion model to learn the RM prior. This approach not only reconstructs the spatial distribution of wireless channel features but also enables environmental structure perception, such as building outlines, and location of BS just relay on pathloss, through integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Remarkably, RadioDiff-Inverse is training-free, leveraging a pre-trained model from Imagenet without task-specific fine-tuning, which significantly reduces the training cost of using generative large model in wireless networks. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioDiff-Inverse achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy of RM construction and environmental reconstruction, and robustness against noisy sparse sampling.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

While recent diffusion models have shown promise, they often struggle with maintaining coherence between known and unknown (missing) regions. This issue arises from the lack of explicit spatial and semantic alignment during the diffusion process, resulting in content that does not smoothly integrate with the original image. Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global learned distributions rather than localized features, leading to inconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work, we propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive Discrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and unknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process. By incorporating CAD, our model progressively reduces discrepancies between generated and original images at each diffusion step, leading to contextually aligned completion. Moreover, ConFill uses a new Dynamic Sampling mechanism that adaptively increases the sampling rate in regions with high reconstruction complexity. This approach enables precise adjustments, enhancing detail and integration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill outperforms current methods, setting a new benchmark in image completion.</p></details> | Accepted in TPAMI |

Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that generalizes over existing isotropic models by considering a hybrid noise scheme. In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also particularly more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation.

With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts.

To achieve this, we introduce FaceCLIP, a multi-modal encoder that learns a joint embedding space for both identity and textual semantics. Given a reference face and a text prompt, FaceCLIP produces a unified representation that encodes both identity and text, which conditions a base diffusion model to generate images that are identity-consistent and text-aligned. We also present a multi-modal alignment algorithm to train FaceCLIP, using a loss that aligns its joint representation with face, text, and image embedding spaces. We then build FaceCLIP-SDXL, an ID-preserving image synthesis pipeline by integrating FaceCLIP with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL).

In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.</p></details> |  |

The approach utilizes Diffusion Maps to uncover possible low-dimensional underlying (latent) spaces in the high-dimensional data (ambient) space. Two approaches for sampling from the latent data density are described. The first is a score-based diffusion model, which is trained to map a standard normal distribution to the latent data distribution using a neural network. The second one involves solving an It\^o stochastic differential equation in the latent space. Additional realizations of the data are generated by lifting the samples back to the ambient space using Double Diffusion Maps, a recently introduced technique typically employed in studying dynamical system reduction; here the focus lies in sampling densities rather than system dynamics. The proposed approaches enable sampling high dimensional data densities restricted to low-dimensional, a priori unknown manifolds. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a benchmark problem and a material with multiscale structure.</p></details> |  |

Recent work on semantic image synthesis mainly follows the de facto GAN-based approaches, which may lead to unsatisfactory quality or diversity of generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on DDPM for semantic image synthesis. Unlike previous conditional diffusion model directly feeds the semantic layout and noisy image as input to a U-Net structure, which may not fully leverage the information in the input semantic mask, our framework processes semantic layout and noisy image differently. It feeds noisy image to the encoder of the U-Net structure while the semantic layout to the decoder by multi-layer spatially-adaptive normalization operators.

Existing generative approaches for multi-target attacks mainly analyze the effect of the use of target labels on noise generation from a theoretical perspective, lacking practical validation and comprehensive summarization. To address this gap, we first identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are critical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature quality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted target features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative information; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the implanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to this feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (2D-TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we design a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring that parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about the target class. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that 2D-TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in attack success rates, both on normally trained models and across various defense mechanisms.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

While diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in text-guided image synthesis, they often lack controllability and fail to preserve layout consistency under non-trivial manipulations such as rotation, translation, scaling, and warping. To address these limitations, DanceText introduces a layered editing strategy that separates text from the background, allowing geometric transformations to be performed in a modular and controllable manner. A depth-aware module is further proposed to align appearance and perspective between the transformed text and the reconstructed background, enhancing photorealism and spatial consistency. Importantly, DanceText adopts a fully training-free design by integrating pretrained modules, allowing flexible deployment without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the AnyWord-3M benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in visual quality, especially under large-scale and complex transformation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Recent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI, fMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for discriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a geometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early AD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art multimodal language models like VAST and LanguageBind are built on vision-language models (VLMs), and thus overly prioritize visual signals. Retrieval benchmarks further reinforce this bias by focusing on visual queries and neglecting other modalities. We create a search system MMMORRF that extracts text and features from both visual and audio modalities and integrates them with a novel modality-aware weighted reciprocal rank fusion. MMMORRF is both effective and efficient, demonstrating practicality in searching videos based on users' information needs instead of visual descriptive queries. We evaluate MMMORRF on MultiVENT 2.0 and TVR, two multimodal benchmarks designed for more targeted information needs, and find that it improves nDCG@20 by 81% over leading multimodal encoders and 37% over single-modality retrieval, demonstrating the value of integrating diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |

At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we propose the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively counters the ``Vanishing Advantages'' dilemma inherent in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 79.0 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 74.0 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI o4-mini.

However, the word representations learnt by language-only models may be limited in that they lack sensory information from other modalities, which several cognitive and neuroscience studies showed to be reflected in human meaning representations. Here, we leverage current pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to investigate whether the integration of visuo-linguistic information they operate leads to representations that are more aligned with human brain activity than those obtained by models trained with language-only input. We focus on fMRI responses recorded while participants read concept words in the context of either a full sentence or a picture. Our results reveal that VLM representations correlate more strongly than those by language-only models with activations in brain areas functionally related to language processing. Additionally, we find that transformer-based vision-language encoders -- e.g., LXMERT and VisualBERT -- yield more brain-aligned representations than generative VLMs, whose autoregressive abilities do not seem to provide an advantage when modelling single words. Finally, our ablation analyses suggest that the high brain alignment achieved by some of the VLMs we evaluate results from semantic information acquired specifically during multimodal pretraining as opposed to being already encoded in their unimodal modules. Altogether, our findings indicate an advantage of multimodal models in predicting human brain activations, which reveals that modelling language and vision integration has the potential to capture the multimodal nature of human concept representations.</p></details> |  |

While existing evaluation studies primarily focus on unimodal (vision-only) comprehension and reasoning capabilities, they overlook critical assessments of complex multimodal reasoning tasks that require integrated understanding of both visual and textual contexts. Such multimodal tasks present unique challenges, demanding sophisticated reasoning across multiple modalities and deep comprehension of multimodal contexts. In this paper, we present MM-InstructEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework that incorporates diverse metrics to assess model performance across various multimodal reasoning tasks with vision-text contexts. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations on 45 models (including 36 MLLMs) across 16 multimodal datasets, encompassing 6 distinct tasks using 10 different instructions. Our framework introduces multiple innovative metrics, including the 'Best Performance' metric to benchmark peak model capabilities, the 'Mean Relative Gain' metric to assess overall efficacy across models and instructions, the 'Stability' metric to measure robustness, and the 'Adaptability' metric to quantify the compatibility between models and instructions. Through comprehensive evaluation and analysis, we uncover several significant insights about model architectures, instruction formats, and their interactions in multimodal reasoning tasks. Our findings establish new benchmarks for assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and provide strategic guidance for future developments. To facilitate continued research and evaluation in this field, we release our framework and resources at https://github.com/declare-lab/MM-InstructEval, with an interactive leaderboard available at MM-InstructEval Leaderboard (https://declare-lab.github.io/MM-InstructEval/).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Information Fusion Journal</p></details> |
| **[Modality Reliability Guided Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16524v1)** | 2025-04-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16524v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation faces an issue of the performance degradation that the uni-modal recommendation sometimes achieves the better performance. A possible reason is that the unreliable item modality data hurts the fusion result. Several existing studies have introduced weights for different modalities to reduce the contribution of the unreliable modality data in predicting the final user rating. However, they fail to provide appropriate supervisions for learning the modality weights, making the learned weights imprecise. Therefore, we propose a modality reliability guided multimodal recommendation framework that uniquely learns the modality weights supervised by the modality reliability. Considering that there is no explicit label provided for modality reliability, we resort to automatically identify it through the BPR recommendation objective. In particular, we define a modality reliability vector as the supervision label by the difference between modality-specific user ratings to positive and negative items, where a larger difference indicates a higher reliability of the modality as the BPR objective is better satisfied. Furthermore, to enhance the effectiveness of the supervision, we calculate the confidence level for the modality reliability vector, which dynamically adjusts the supervision strength and eliminates the harmful supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Despite the remarkable performance exhibited by previous MSA approaches, the presence of inherent multimodal heterogeneities poses a challenge, with the contribution of different modalities varying considerably. Past research predominantly focused on improving representation learning techniques and feature fusion strategies. However, many of these efforts overlooked the variation in semantic richness among different modalities, treating each modality uniformly. This approach may lead to underestimating the significance of strong modalities while overemphasizing the importance of weak ones. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a Text-oriented Cross-Attention Network (TCAN), emphasizing the predominant role of the text modality in MSA. Specifically, for each multimodal sample, by taking unaligned sequences of the three modalities as inputs, we initially allocate the extracted unimodal features into a visual-text and an acoustic-text pair. Subsequently, we implement self-attention on the text modality and apply text-queried cross-attention to the visual and acoustic modalities. To mitigate the influence of noise signals and redundant features, we incorporate a gated control mechanism into the framework. Additionally, we introduce unimodal joint learning to gain a deeper understanding of homogeneous emotional tendencies across diverse modalities through backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that TCAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MSA methods on two datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI).</p></details> |  |

MMLA: A Comprehensive Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16427v1)** | 2025-04-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16427v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances. Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field. The datasets and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

However, whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can similarly understand the 4D world remains uncertain. This paper explores multimodal spatial-temporal reasoning from an egocentric perspective, aiming to equip MLLMs with human-like reasoning capabilities. To support this objective, we introduce \textbf{Ego-ST Bench}, a novel benchmark containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs across four categories, systematically evaluating spatial, temporal, and integrated spatial-temporal reasoning. Additionally, we propose \textbf{ST-R1} training paradigm, a video-based reasoning model that incorporates reverse thinking into its reinforcement learning process, significantly enhancing performance. We combine long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, achieving notable improvements with limited high-quality data. Ego-ST Bench and ST-R1 provide valuable insights and resources for advancing video-based spatial-temporal reasoning research.</p></details> |  |

However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone. Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification. Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models. Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models. Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

However, this increased sophistication introduces significant safety concerns. In this paper, we present the first evaluation and analysis of a novel safety challenge termed Multimodal Situational Safety, which explores how safety considerations vary based on the specific situation in which the user or agent is engaged. We argue that for an MLLM to respond safely, whether through language or action, it often needs to assess the safety implications of a language query within its corresponding visual context. To evaluate this capability, we develop the Multimodal Situational Safety benchmark (MSSBench) to assess the situational safety performance of current MLLMs. The dataset comprises 1,820 language query-image pairs, half of which the image context is safe, and the other half is unsafe. We also develop an evaluation framework that analyzes key safety aspects, including explicit safety reasoning, visual understanding, and, crucially, situational safety reasoning. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle with this nuanced safety problem in the instruction-following setting and struggle to tackle these situational safety challenges all at once, highlighting a key area for future research. Furthermore, we develop multi-agent pipelines to coordinately solve safety challenges, which shows consistent improvement in safety over the original MLLM response.

Due to the complex service invocation paths and dependencies in enterprise-level microservice systems, it is challenging to locate the anomalies promptly during service invocations, thus causing intractable issues for normal system operations and maintenance. In this paper, we propose a Causal Heterogeneous grAph baSed framEwork for root cause analysis, namely CHASE, for microservice systems with multimodal data, including traces, logs, and system monitoring metrics. Specifically, related information is encoded into representative embeddings and further modeled by a multimodal invocation graph. Following that, anomaly detection is performed on each instance node with attentive heterogeneous message passing from its adjacent metric and log nodes. Finally, CHASE learns from the constructed hypergraph with hyperedges representing the flow of causality and performs root cause localization. We evaluate the proposed framework on two public microservice datasets with distinct attributes and compare with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that CHASE achieves the average performance gain up to 36.2%(A@1) and 29.4%(Percentage@1), respectively to its best counterpart.</p></details> |  |

The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Beyond key video segment extraction from the raw laryngeal videos, MLVAS is able to generate effective audio and visual features for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. Pre-trained audio encoders are utilized to encode the patient voice to get the audio features. Visual features are generated by measuring the angle deviation of both the left and right vocal folds to the estimated glottal midline on the segmented glottis masks. To get better masks, we introduce a diffusion-based refinement that follows traditional U-Net segmentation to reduce false positives. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and modalities in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, unilateral VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.</p></details> | Submitted to CSL |

Despite extensive efforts and significant achievements in existing MASC, substantial gaps remain in understanding fine-grained visual content and the cognitive rationales derived from semantic content and impressions (cognitive interpretations of emotions evoked by image content). In this study, we present Chimera: a cognitive and aesthetic sentiment causality understanding framework to derive fine-grained holistic features of aspects and infer the fundamental drivers of sentiment expression from both semantic perspectives and affective-cognitive resonance (the synergistic effect between emotional responses and cognitive interpretations). Specifically, this framework first incorporates visual patch features for patch-word alignment. Meanwhile, it extracts coarse-grained visual features (e.g., overall image representation) and fine-grained visual regions (e.g., aspect-related regions) and translates them into corresponding textual descriptions (e.g., facial, aesthetic). Finally, we leverage the sentimental causes and impressions generated by a large language model (LLM) to enhance the model's awareness of sentimental cues evoked by semantic content and affective-cognitive resonance. Experimental results on standard MASC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which also exhibits greater flexibility to MASC compared to LLMs such as GPT-4o. We have publicly released the complete implementation and dataset at https://github.com/Xillv/Chimera</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TAFFC 2025</p></details> |

Methods based on synthetic data are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data but require a high degree of realism and controllability in order to be useful. This paper introduces MObI, a novel framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to create realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated for both camera and lidar simultaneously. Using a single reference RGB image, MObI enables objects to be seamlessly inserted into existing multimodal scenes at a 3D location specified by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, our 3D bounding box conditioning gives objects accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. As a result, our approach can be used to insert novel objects flexibly into multimodal scenes, providing significant advantages for testing perception models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; Project page at https://alexbubu.com/mobi</p></details> |
| **[BaThe: Defense against the Jailbreak Attack in Multimodal Large Language Models by Treating Harmful Instruction as Backdoor Trigger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09093v3)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.09093v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased impressive performance in a variety of multimodal tasks. On the other hand, the integration of additional image modality may allow the malicious users to inject harmful content inside the images for jailbreaking. Unlike text-based LLMs, where adversaries need to select discrete tokens to conceal their malicious intent using specific algorithms, the continuous nature of image signals provides a direct opportunity for adversaries to inject harmful intentions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{BaThe}$ ($\textbf{Ba}$ckdoor $\textbf{T}$rigger S$\textbf{h}$i$\textbf{e}$ld), a simple yet effective jailbreak defense mechanism. Our work is motivated by recent research on jailbreak backdoor attack and virtual prompt backdoor attack in generative language models. Jailbreak backdoor attack uses harmful instructions combined with manually crafted strings as triggers to make the backdoored model generate prohibited responses. We assume that harmful instructions can function as triggers, and if we alternatively set rejection responses as the triggered response, the backdoored model then can defend against jailbreak attacks. We achieve this by utilizing virtual rejection prompt, similar to the virtual prompt backdoor attack. We embed the virtual rejection prompt into the soft text embeddings, which we call ``wedge''. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BaThe effectively mitigates various types of jailbreak attacks and is adaptable to defend against unseen attacks, with minimal impact on MLLMs' performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vidi: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15681v1)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.15681v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This survey offers a comprehensive analysis of multimodal navigation approaches through the unifying perspective of inference domains, exploring how agents perceive, reason about, and navigate environments using visual, linguistic, and acoustic information. Our key contributions include organizing navigation methods based on their primary environmental reasoning mechanisms across inference domains; systematically analyzing how shared computational foundations support seemingly disparate approaches across different navigation tasks; identifying recurring patterns and distinctive strengths across various navigation paradigms; and examining the integration challenges and opportunities of multimodal perception to enhance navigation capabilities. In addition, we review approximately 200 relevant articles to provide an in-depth understanding of the current landscape.</p></details> |  |

However, these general-domain MLLMs perform poorly in face perception tasks, often producing inaccurate or misleading responses to face-specific queries. To address this gap, we propose FaceInsight, the versatile face perception MLLM that provides fine-grained facial information. Our approach introduces visual-textual alignment of facial knowledge to model both uncertain dependencies and deterministic relationships among facial information, mitigating the limitations of language-driven reasoning. Additionally, we incorporate face segmentation maps as an auxiliary perceptual modality, enriching the visual input with localized structural cues to enhance semantic understanding. Comprehensive experiments and analyses across three face perception tasks demonstrate that FaceInsight consistently outperforms nine compared MLLMs under both training-free and fine-tuned settings.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, a previous version is accepted for presentation at the Conference on Advanced Systems in Public Transport and TransitData 2025 in Kyoto, Japan on 1 - 4 July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Harmonizing Visual Representations for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21979v2)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.21979v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying visual understanding and generation within a single multimodal framework remains a significant challenge, as the two inherently heterogeneous tasks require representations at different levels of granularity. Current approaches that utilize vector quantization (VQ) or variational autoencoders (VAE) for unified visual representation prioritize intrinsic imagery features over semantics, compromising understanding performance. In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/wusize/Harmon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manipulating Multimodal Agents via Cross-Modal Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14348v2)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.14348v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Evaluating the Robustness of Multimodal Agents Against Active Environmental Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13053v2)** | 2025-04-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.13053v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As researchers continue to optimize AI agents for more effective task execution within operating systems, they often overlook a critical security concern: the ability of these agents to detect "impostors" within their environment. Through an analysis of the agents' operational context, we identify a significant threat-attackers can disguise malicious attacks as environmental elements, injecting active disturbances into the agents' execution processes to manipulate their decision-making. We define this novel threat as the Active Environment Injection Attack (AEIA). Focusing on the interaction mechanisms of the Android OS, we conduct a risk assessment of AEIA and identify two critical security vulnerabilities: (1) Adversarial content injection in multimodal interaction interfaces, where attackers embed adversarial instructions within environmental elements to mislead agent decision-making; and (2) Reasoning gap vulnerabilities in the agent's task execution process, which increase susceptibility to AEIA attacks during reasoning. To evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities, we propose AEIA-MN, an attack scheme that exploits interaction vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems to assess the robustness of MLLM-based agents. Experimental results show that even advanced MLLMs are highly vulnerable to this attack, achieving a maximum attack success rate of 93% on the AndroidWorld benchmark by combining two vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wa...</summary><p>We want to withdraw this paper and revise its experimental details.

Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[See or Recall: A Sanity Check for the Role of Vision in Solving Visualization Question Answer Tasks with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09809v2)** | 2025-04-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.09809v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have equipped language models to reason about vision and language jointly. This permits MLLMs to both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety of designs and tasks. Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks requires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to conduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning capability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of visualizations (e.g., visualization literacy). However, we found that in the context of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and reasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans approach the same problem. During the evaluation, even without visualization, the model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization test questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided. We hypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model permits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the visual signal. It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not fully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a rule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of "seeing" (visual processing) and "recall" (reliance on prior knowledge). This validates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly "seeing", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying on inductive biases for question answering. Our study underscores the need for careful consideration in designing future visualization understanding studies when utilizing MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose IV-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Image-Grounded Video Perception and Reasoning. IV-Bench consists of 967 videos paired with 2,585 meticulously annotated image-text queries across 13 tasks (7 perception and 6 reasoning tasks) and 5 representative categories. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open-source (e.g., InternVL2.5, Qwen2.5-VL) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini2-Flash and Gemini2-Pro) MLLMs demonstrate that current models substantially underperform in image-grounded video Perception and Reasoning, merely achieving at most 28.9% accuracy. Further analysis reveals key factors influencing model performance on IV-Bench, including inference pattern, frame number, and resolution. Additionally, through a simple data synthesis approach, we demonstratethe challenges of IV- Bench extend beyond merely aligning the data format in the training proecss. These findings collectively provide valuable insights for future research. Our codes and data are released in https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/IV-Bench.</p></details> |  |

This paper reviews the transformative potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in addressing these limitations by integrating cross-modal data such as visual, spatial, and environmental inputs to enable holistic scene understanding. Through a comprehensive analysis of MLLM-based approaches, we highlight their capabilities in enhancing perception, decision-making, and adversarial robustness, while also examining the role of key datasets (e.g., KITTI, DRAMA, ML4RoadSafety) in advancing research. Furthermore, we outline future directions, including real-time edge deployment, causality-driven reasoning, and human-AI collaboration. By positioning MLLMs as a cornerstone for next-generation traffic safety systems, this review underscores their potential to revolutionize the field, offering scalable, context-aware solutions that proactively mitigate risks and improve overall road safety.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in multimodal entity linking (MEL) have shown that combining text and images can reduce ambiguity and improve alignment accuracy. However, most existing MEL methods overlook the rich structural information available in the form of knowledge-graph (KG) triples. In this paper, we propose KGMEL, a novel framework that leverages KG triples to enhance MEL. Specifically, it operates in three stages: (1) Generation: Produces high-quality triples for each mention by employing vision-language models based on its text and images. (2) Retrieval: Learns joint mention-entity representations, via contrastive learning, that integrate text, images, and (generated or KG) triples to retrieve candidate entities for each mention. (3) Reranking: Refines the KG triples of the candidate entities and employs large language models to identify the best-matching entity for the mention. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGMEL outperforms existing methods.

Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence. In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings. In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis. Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes. Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator. Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset. We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025), 22 - 26 July 2025, Palermo, Italy. 17 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on generating text-only answers, even in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) scenarios, where multimodal elements are retrieved to assist in generating text answers. To address this, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, in which we aim to generate multimodal answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite growing attention to this challenging task, a notable lack of a comprehensive benchmark persists for effectively evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we provide MRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct datasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets incorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of generative models in the MRAMG task. Additionally, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal answer generation framework that can leverage LLMs/MLLMs to generate multimodal responses.

These archives, widely used as supplementary resources in modern education, often consist of long, unedited recordings that make it difficult to keep students engaged. Captured directly from face-to-face lectures without post-processing, they lack visual appeal. Meanwhile, the increasing volume of recorded material renders manual editing and annotation impractical. Automatically detecting high-engagement segments is thus crucial for improving accessibility and maintaining learning effectiveness. Our research focuses on real classroom lecture archives, characterized by unedited footage, no additional hardware (e.g., eye-tracking), and limited student numbers. We approximate student engagement using segment access frequency as a proxy. Our model integrates multimodal features from teachers' actions (via OpenPose and optical flow), audio spectrograms, and slide page progression. These features are deliberately chosen for their non-semantic nature, making the approach applicable regardless of lecture language. Experiments show that our best model achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.5143 in 7-fold cross-validation and 69.32 percent average accuracy in a downstream three-class classification task. The results, obtained with high computational efficiency and a small dataset, demonstrate the practical feasibility of our system in real-world educational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract latent patterns from massive network traffic, demonstrating significant potential for IoT traffic classification tasks. However, the limited computational and spatial resources of IoT devices pose challenges for deploying more complex deep learning models. Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or raw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire or most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while raw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads, overlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal learning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification. Firstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation by parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and standardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the characterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic. Subsequently, the traffic representation is fed into a resource-efficient neural network comprising a multimodal feature extraction module and a multimodal fusion module. The extraction module employs efficient depthwise separable convolutions to capture multi-scale features from different modalities while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The fusion module adaptively captures complementary features from different modalities and effectively fuses multimodal features.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic data detection has thus garnered widespread attention, and the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in this task has attracted significant interest. LMMs can provide natural language explanations for their authenticity judgments, enhancing the explainability of synthetic content detection. Simultaneously, the task of distinguishing between real and synthetic data effectively tests the perception, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities of LMMs. In response, we introduce LOKI, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to detect synthetic data across multiple modalities.

These models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks of multimodal information retrieval (MIR), including web search, cross-modal retrieval, and recommender systems, etc. However, due to their enormous parameter sizes, significant efficiency challenges emerge across training, deployment, and inference stages when adapting these models' representation for IR tasks. These challenges present substantial obstacles to the practical adaptation of foundation models for representation learning in information retrieval tasks. To address these pressing issues, we propose organizing the first EReL@MIR workshop at the Web Conference 2025, inviting participants to explore novel solutions, emerging problems, challenges, efficiency evaluation metrics and benchmarks. This workshop aims to provide a platform for both academic and industry researchers to engage in discussions, share insights, and foster collaboration toward achieving efficient and effective representation learning for multimodal information retrieval in the era of large foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>WWW20...</summary><p>WWW2025 Workshop Summary</p></details> |

Integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of the clinical condition of a patient, improving diagnosis and treatment decision. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently demonstrate outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit. We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex and multi-class Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI tabular data fusion methods.

Existing approaches rely on spatial visual tokens, where image patches are encoded and arranged according to a spatial order (e.g., raster scan). However, we show that spatial tokens lack the recursive structure inherent to languages, hence form an impossible language for LLM to master. In this paper, we build a proper visual language by leveraging diffusion timesteps to learn discrete, recursive visual tokens. Our proposed tokens recursively compensate for the progressive attribute loss in noisy images as timesteps increase, enabling the diffusion model to reconstruct the original image at any timestep. This approach allows us to effectively integrate the strengths of LLMs in autoregressive reasoning and diffusion models in precise image generation, achieving seamless multimodal comprehension and generation within a unified framework. Extensive experiments show that we achieve superior performance for multimodal comprehension and generation simultaneously compared with other MLLMs. Project Page: https://DDT-LLaMA.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Multidimensional human motion data significantly deepen the understanding of the complex mechanisms governing neuromuscular alterations, thereby facilitating the development and application of rehabilitation robots in multifaceted real-world environments. However, currently available lower limb datasets are inadequate for supplying the essential multimodal data and large-scale gait samples necessary for effective data-driven approaches, and they neglect the significant effects of acquisition interference in real applications.To fill this gap, we present the K2MUSE dataset, which includes a comprehensive collection of multimodal data, comprising kinematic, kinetic, amplitude-mode ultrasound (AUS), and surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements. The proposed dataset includes lower limb multimodal data from 30 able-bodied participants walking under different inclines (0$^\circ$, $\pm$5$^\circ$, and $\pm$10$^\circ$), various speeds (0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, and 1.5 m/s), and different nonideal acquisition conditions (muscle fatigue, electrode shifts, and inter-day differences). The kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected via a Vicon motion capture system and an instrumented treadmill with embedded force plates, whereas the sEMG and AUS data were synchronously recorded for thirteen muscles on the bilateral lower limbs. This dataset offers a new resource for designing control frameworks for rehabilitation robots and conducting biomechanical analyses of lower limb locomotion.

As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, its ability to synthesise realistic content emerges as a threat in the hands of cybercriminals who seek to manipulate and misrepresent the truth. Such synthetic content introduces a non-trivial risk of overwriting the subtle changes made for the purpose of steganography. When the signals in both the spatial and temporal domains are vulnerable to unforeseen overwriting, it calls for reflection on what, if any, remains invariant. This study proposes a paradigm in steganography for audiovisual media, where messages are concealed beyond both spatial and temporal domains. A chain of multimodal artificial intelligence is developed to deconstruct audiovisual content into a cover text, embed a message within the linguistic domain, and then reconstruct the audiovisual content through synchronising both auditory and visual modalities with the resultant stego text. The message is encoded by biasing the word sampling process of a language generation model and decoded by analysing the probability distribution of word choices. The accuracy of message transmission is evaluated under both zero-bit and multi-bit capacity settings. Fidelity is assessed through both biometric and semantic similarities, capturing the identities of the recorded face and voice, as well as the core ideas conveyed through the media. Secrecy is examined through statistical comparisons between cover and stego texts. Robustness is tested across various scenarios, including audiovisual resampling, face-swapping, voice-cloning and their combinations.</p></details> |  |

Its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal continuity make it particularly well-suited for developing large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). These models serve as powerful feature extractors, leveraging extensive RS data for pretraining and subsequent fine-tuning in various geoscientific applications. However, existing VFMs in the RS domain often concentrate on specific image characteristics, neglecting the full season-aware potential of RS data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SeaMo, a novel VFM that effectively integrates multimodal and multi-seasonal RS information. SeaMo leverages a masked image modeling framework to fully exploit the spatial, spectral, and seasonal dimensions of RS data. Specifically, we employ unaligned spatial region selection to capture spatial heterogeneity, incorporate multi-source inputs for enhanced multimodal integration, and introduce temporal-multimodal fusion blocks to assimilate seasonal variations effectively. By explicitly modeling the complex, season-dependent attributes of RS data, SeaMo enhances generalization, robustness, and adaptability across geoscientific tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate its superior performance, underscoring its potential as a foundational model for Earth observation.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional attention mechanisms, despite notable benchmarks, are hindered by quadratic complexity, limiting their ability to fully capture global contextual dependencies and rich semantic information in both modalities. To address this limitation, we introduce DualKanbaFormer, a novel framework that leverages parallel Textual and Visual KanbaFormer modules for robust multimodal analysis. Our approach incorporates Aspect-Driven Sparse Attention (ADSA) to dynamically balance coarse-grained aggregation and fine-grained selection for aspect-focused precision, ensuring the preservation of both global context awareness and local precision in textual and visual representations. Additionally, we utilize the Selective State Space Model (Mamba) to capture extensive global semantic information across both modalities. Furthermore, We replace traditional feed-forward networks and normalization with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Dynamic Tanh (DyT) to enhance non-linear expressivity and inference stability. To facilitate the effective integration of textual and visual features, we design a multimodal gated fusion layer that dynamically optimizes inter-modality interactions, significantly enhancing the models efficacy in MABSA tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two publicly available datasets reveal that DualKanbaFormer consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |

Differences are evident when speakers come from diverse cultures due to the unique experiences that shape perception. Machine translation of captions has pushed multilingual capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs), but data comes mainly from English speakers, indicating a perceptual bias and lack of model flexibility. In this work, we address this challenge and outline a data-efficient framework to instill multilingual VLMs with greater understanding of perceptual diversity. We specifically propose an LLM-based, multimodal recaptioning strategy that alters the object descriptions of English captions before translation. The greatest benefits are demonstrated in a targeted multimodal mechanism guided by native speaker data. By adding produced rewrites as augmentations in training, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval cases studies (up to +3.5 mean recall overall, +4.7 on non-native error cases). We further propose a mechanism to analyze the specific object description differences across datasets, and we offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.</p></details> |  |

In the era of rapidly growing mutimodal content and social media, MCR is particularly crucial for interpreting user interactions and bridging text-visual references to improve communication and personalization. However, MCR research for real-world dialogues remains unexplored due to the lack of sufficient data resources.To address this gap, we introduce TikTalkCoref, the first Chinese multimodal coreference dataset for social media in real-world scenarios, derived from the popular Douyin short-video platform. This dataset pairs short videos with corresponding textual dialogues from user comments and includes manually annotated coreference clusters for both person mentions in the text and the coreferential person head regions in the corresponding video frames. We also present an effective benchmark approach for MCR, focusing on the celebrity domain, and conduct extensive experiments on our dataset, providing reliable benchmark results for this newly constructed dataset. We will release the TikTalkCoref dataset to facilitate future research on MCR for real-world social media dialogues.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks.

However, their ability to detect subtle visual spoofing and forgery clues in face attack detection tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, SHIELD, to evaluate MLLMs for face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to assess MLLM performance on multimodal face data across two tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, and depth) under six attack types. For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data, incorporating visual and acoustic modalities. We conduct zero-shot and few-shot evaluations in standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-attribute chain of thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images. The findings of this study demonstrate that MLLMs exhibit strong potential for addressing the challenges associated with the security of facial recognition technology applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Visual Intelligence</p></details> |

In particular, data-driven algorithms have significantly improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. Meteorological data is often transformed into 2D images or 3D videos, which are then fed into AI models for learning. Additionally, these models often incorporate physical signals, such as temperature, pressure, and wind speed, to further enhance accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we review several representative AI + Weather/Climate algorithms and propose a new paradigm where observational data from different perspectives, each with distinct physical meanings, are treated as multimodal data and integrated via transformers. Furthermore, key weather and climate knowledge can be incorporated through regularization techniques to further strengthen the model's capabilities. This new paradigm is versatile and can address a variety of tasks, offering strong generalizability. We also discuss future directions for improving model accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> | Perspective article |

Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.</p></details> | Technical Report |

While these models can accept flexible combinations of input data, their training efficiency suffers from two major issues: pipeline stage imbalance caused by heterogeneous model architectures, and training data dynamicity stemming from the diversity of multimodal data. In this paper, we present PipeWeaver, a dynamic pipeline scheduling framework designed for LMM training. The core of PipeWeaver is dynamic interleaved pipeline, which searches for pipeline schedules dynamically tailored to current training batches. PipeWeaver addresses issues of LMM training with two techniques: adaptive modality-aware partitioning and efficient pipeline schedule search within a hierarchical schedule space. Meanwhile, PipeWeaver utilizes SEMU (Step Emulator), a training simulator for multimodal models, for accurate performance estimations, accelerated by spatial-temporal subgraph reuse to improve search efficiency. Experiments show that PipeWeaver can enhance LMM training efficiency by up to 97.3% compared to state-of-the-art systems, and demonstrate excellent adaptivity to LMM training's data dynamicity.</p></details> |  |

Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.</p></details> | IJCNN 2025 |

However, instructing LLMs using natural language is limited in precision and expressiveness for conveying visualization intent, leading to misinterpretation and time-consuming iterations. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret ambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring, and the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the findings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text prompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation abilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization authoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create visualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct manipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a controlled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive way to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency compared to text-only prompting approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of text and visual prompts in different visualization tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal prompting in improving the usability of LLMs for visualization authoring. We discuss design implications for future visualization systems and provide insights into how multimodal prompts can enhance human-AI collaboration in creative visualization tasks.

Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</p></details> |  |

These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

Despite advancements in generating music from specific textual descriptions (e.g., style, genre, instruments), the practical application is still hindered by ordinary users' limited expertise or time to write accurate prompts. To bridge this application gap, this paper introduces MusFlow, a novel multimodal music generation model using Conditional Flow Matching. We employ multiple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to align multimodal conditional information into the audio's CLAP embedding space. Conditional flow matching is trained to reconstruct the compressed Mel-spectrogram in the pretrained VAE latent space guided by aligned feature embedding. MusFlow can generate music from images, story texts, and music captions. To collect data for model training, inspired by multi-agent collaboration, we construct an intelligent data annotation workflow centered around a fine-tuned Qwen2-VL model. Using this workflow, we build a new multimodal music dataset, MMusSet, with each sample containing a quadruple of image, story text, music caption, and music piece. We conduct four sets of experiments: image-to-music, story-to-music, caption-to-music, and multimodal music generation. Experimental results demonstrate that MusFlow can generate high-quality music pieces whether the input conditions are unimodal or multimodal. We hope this work can advance the application of music generation in multimedia field, making music creation more accessible. Our generated samples, code and dataset are available at musflow.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.

Enhancing Multimodal Pretraining with Missing Modalities through Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13465v1)** | 2025-04-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13465v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.</p></details> |  |

To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</p></details> |  |

To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multimodal large language model for proteins that enables users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers to ensure precise representation adaptation and leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses.

However, many manipulation tasks require changing control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task. To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human demonstration data -- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>WIP, ...</summary><p>WIP, Homepage https://github.com/songrise/MLLM4Art</p></details> |

Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods deal with fake news videos as a classification problem, but it's not clear why news videos are identified as fake. Without proper explanation, the end user may not understand the underlying meaning of the falsehood. Therefore, we propose a new problem - Fake news video Explanation (FNVE) - given a multimodal news post containing a video and title, our goal is to generate natural language explanations to reveal the falsity of the news video. To that end, we developed FakeVE, a new dataset of 2,672 fake news video posts that can definitively explain four real-life fake news video aspects. In order to understand the characteristics of fake news video explanation, we conducted an exploratory analysis of FakeVE from different perspectives. In addition, we propose a Multimodal Relation Graph Transformer (MRGT) based on the architecture of multimodal Transformer to benchmark FakeVE. The empirical results show that the results of the various benchmarks (adopted by FakeVE) are convincing and provide a detailed analysis of the differences in explanation generation of the benchmark models.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating both Vision Language Models and custom-trained classifiers, we show that while zero-shot prompting offers quick deployment, even simple trained models outperform them when labelled data is available, by up to 23%. Our findings highlight the enduring importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.</p></details> |  |

We present an approach to computer-aided design and precision assessment of positioning occlusal splints, bridging clinical concepts with current digital dental practice. In our model, a 3D splint is generated based on a transformation matrix that represents the therapeutic change in mandibular position, defined by a specialist using a virtual patient model reconstructed from intraoral scans, CBCT, 3D facial scans and plaster model digitisation. The paper introduces a novel method for generating splints that accurately reproduce occlusal conditions in the therapeutic position, including a mechanism for resolving surface conflicts through virtual embossing. We demonstrate how transformation matrices can be acquired through clinical tools and intraoral devices, and evaluate the accuracy of the designed and printed splints using profile and surface deviation analysis. The proposed method enables reproducible, patient-specific splint fabrication and opens new possibilities in diagnostics, multimodal image registration and quantification of occlusal discrepancies.</p></details> |  |

Previous GAN inversion-based methods usually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the realistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard constraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the same, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus degrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often consider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues in images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN inversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill contains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN generator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to enhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge texture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a pre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To mitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we introduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting. Furthermore, in order to reconstruct faithful and photorealistic images, we devise a simple yet effective Soft-update Mean Latent module to capture more diversified in-domain patterns for generating high-fidelity textures for massive corruptions. In our extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, we show that our MMInvertFill qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-arts and it supports the completion of out-of-domain images effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.11850</p></details> |

By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 34 pages, 7 figures |

We propose Emotion Interpretation (EI), focusing on causal factors-whether explicit (e.g., observable objects, interpersonal interactions) or implicit (e.g., cultural context, off-screen events)-that drive emotional responses. Unlike traditional emotion recognition, EI tasks require reasoning about triggers instead of mere labeling. To facilitate EI research, we present EIBench, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 1,615 basic EI samples and 50 complex EI samples featuring multifaceted emotions. Each instance demands rationale-based explanations rather than straightforward categorization.

However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving (GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning, \textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train \textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems, GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs, achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS task.

Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection.

However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework.

Current endeavors for determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset ownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques, while cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt to multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods rely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable behaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free perspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal perturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific distribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes as fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is derived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between different modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt with GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully crafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of datasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger during retrieval queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against unauthorized multimodal dataset usage on various cross-modal retrieval architectures by 30% over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Humans exhibit strong reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of $65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement, which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.

However, a substantial volume of multimodal interleaved documents remains underutilized for contrastive vision-language representation learning. To fully leverage these unpaired documents, we initially establish a Real-World Data Extraction pipeline to extract high-quality images and texts. Then we design a hierarchical retrieval method to efficiently associate each image with multiple semantically relevant realistic texts. To further enhance fine-grained visual information, we propose an image semantic augmented generation module for synthetic text production. Furthermore, we employ a semantic balance sampling strategy to improve dataset diversity, enabling better learning of long-tail concepts. Based on these innovations, we construct RealSyn, a dataset combining realistic and synthetic texts, available in three scales: 15M, 30M, and 100M. We compare our dataset with other widely used datasets of equivalent scale for CLIP training. Models pre-trained on RealSyn consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, including linear probe, zero-shot transfer, zero-shot robustness, and zero-shot retrieval. Furthermore, extensive experiments confirm that RealSyn significantly enhances contrastive vision-language representation learning and demonstrates robust scalability.

Specifically, we investigate the applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in existing perception datasets annotated by humans.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a new technique AMPS that augments a multilingual multimodal ASR system with paraphrase-based supervision for improved conversational ASR in multiple languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, and Nyanja. We use paraphrases of the reference transcriptions as additional supervision while training the multimodal ASR model and selectively invoke this paraphrase objective for utterances with poor ASR performance. Using AMPS with a state-of-the-art multimodal model SeamlessM4T, we obtain significant relative reductions in word error rates (WERs) of up to 5%. We present detailed analyses of our system using both objective and human evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the demand for multimodal machine learning models has sharply risen for modalities that go beyond vision and language, such as sequences, graphs, time series, or tabular data. While there are many available multimodal fusion and alignment approaches, most of them require end-to-end training, scale quadratically with the number of modalities, cannot handle cases of high modality imbalance in the training set, or are highly topology-specific, making them too restrictive for many biomedical learning tasks. This paper presents Multimodal Lego (MM-Lego), a general-purpose fusion framework to turn any set of encoders into a competitive multimodal model with no or minimal fine-tuning. We achieve this by introducing a wrapper for any unimodal encoder that enforces shape consistency between modality representations. It harmonises these representations by learning features in the frequency domain to enable model merging with little signal interference. We show that MM-Lego 1) can be used as a model merging method which achieves competitive performance with end-to-end fusion models without any fine-tuning, 2) can operate on any unimodal encoder, and 3) is a model fusion method that, with minimal fine-tuning, surpasses all benchmarks in five out of seven datasets.</p></details> |  |

It has been shown to influence human perception and decision-making, often leading to biased judgments that favor those deemed attractive in what is referred to as "the attractiveness halo effect". While extensively studied in human judgments in a broad set of domains, including hiring, judicial sentencing or credit granting, the role that attractiveness plays in the assessments and decisions made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is unknown. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study using 91 socially relevant scenarios and a diverse dataset of 924 face images, corresponding to 462 individuals both with and without beauty filters applied to them, evaluated on LLaVA, a state-of-the-art, open source MLLM. Our analysis reveals that attractiveness impacts the decisions made by the MLLM in over 80% of the scenarios, demonstrating substantial bias in model behavior in what we refer to as an attractiveness bias. Similarly to humans, we find empirical evidence of the existence of the attractiveness halo effect, such that more attractive individuals are more likely to be attributed positive traits, such as intelligence or confidence, by the MLLM. Furthermore, we uncover a gender, age and race bias in 83%, 73% and 57% of the scenarios, respectively, which is impacted by attractiveness, particularly in the case of gender, highlighting the intersectional nature of the attractiveness bias. Our findings suggest that societal stereotypes and cultural norms intersect with perceptions of attractiveness, amplifying or mitigating this bias in multimodal generative AI models in a complex way. Our work emphasizes the need to account for intersectionality in algorithmic bias detection and mitigation efforts and underscores the challenges of addressing bias in modern multimodal large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Fusion and Balanced Learning in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12151v1)** | 2025-04-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12151v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) faces two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability in the decision logic of multimodal fusion and modality imbalance caused by disparities in inter-modal information density. To address these issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the interpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the Multimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its univariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of cross-modal interactions. This structural design allows direct inspection of feature transformations without relying on external interpretation tools, thereby ensuring both high expressiveness and interpretability. Second, the proposed MCPareto enhances robustness by addressing modality imbalance and noise interference. Specifically, we introduce the Dimensionality Reduction and Denoising Modal Information Bottleneck (DRD-MIB) method, which jointly denoises and reduces feature dimensionality. This approach provides KAN with discriminative low-dimensional inputs to reduce the modeling complexity of KAN while preserving critical sentiment-related information. Furthermore, MCPareto dynamically balances gradient contributions across modalities using the purified features output by DRD-MIB, ensuring lossless transmission of auxiliary signals and effectively alleviating modality imbalance. This synergy of interpretability and robustness not only achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS v2 but also offers an intuitive visualization interface through KAN's interpretable architecture.</p></details> |  |

However, most FL systems assume clients hold only unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions often possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further constrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA, a novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized local model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to learn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data heterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that works effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose multimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ contrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure the independence between aligned features and context features within each modality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental results show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in multimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.</p></details> |  |

Current methods, including those based on Visual Question Answering (VQA), still struggle with fine-grained assessments and precise quantification of image-text alignment. This paper presents an improved evaluation method named Instruction-augmented Multimodal Alignment for Image-Text and Element Matching (iMatch), which evaluates image-text semantic alignment by fine-tuning multimodal large language models. We introduce four innovative augmentation strategies: First, the QAlign strategy creates a precise probabilistic mapping to convert discrete scores from multimodal large language models into continuous matching scores. Second, a validation set augmentation strategy uses pseudo-labels from model predictions to expand training data, boosting the model's generalization performance. Third, an element augmentation strategy integrates element category labels to refine the model's understanding of image-text matching. Fourth, an image augmentation strategy employs techniques like random lighting to increase the model's robustness. Additionally, we propose prompt type augmentation and score perturbation strategies to further enhance the accuracy of element assessments. Our experimental results show that the iMatch method significantly surpasses existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and practical value. Furthermore, our iMatch won first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2025 Text to Image Generation Model Quality Assessment - Track 1 Image-Text Alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |

This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: selection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables shared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of misalignment on multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, their integration introduces a new attack surface for social engineering. In this paper, we systematically investigate the feasibility of orchestrating AR-driven Social Engineering attacks using Multimodal LLM for the first time, via our proposed SEAR framework, which operates through three key phases: (1) AR-based social context synthesis, which fuses Multimodal inputs (visual, auditory and environmental cues); (2) role-based Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which dynamically retrieves and integrates contextual data while preserving character differentiation; and (3) ReInteract social engineering agents, which execute adaptive multiphase attack strategies through inference interaction loops. To verify SEAR, we conducted an IRB-approved study with 60 participants in three experimental configurations (unassisted, AR+LLM, and full SEAR pipeline) compiling a new dataset of 180 annotated conversations in simulated social scenarios. Our results show that SEAR is highly effective at eliciting high-risk behaviors (e.g., 93.3% of participants susceptible to email phishing). The framework was particularly effective in building trust, with 85% of targets willing to accept an attacker's call after an interaction. Also, we identified notable limitations such as ``occasionally artificial'' due to perceived authenticity gaps. This work provides proof-of-concept for AR-LLM driven social engineering attacks and insights for developing defensive countermeasures against next-generation augmented reality threats.</p></details> |  |

These images encompass a broad spectrum of visual expressions ranging from landscapes to artistic depictions. Users request recommendations for books or music that evoke similar feelings to those captured in the images, and recommendations are endorsed by the community through upvotes. This dataset supports two recommendation tasks: title generation and multiple-choice selection. Our experiments with large foundation models reveal their limitations in these tasks. Particularly, vision-language models show no significant advantage over language-only counterparts that use descriptions, which we hypothesize is due to underutilized visual capabilities. To better harness these abilities, we propose the chain-of-imagery prompting, which results in notable improvements. We release our code and datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bytedance.github.io/dplm/dplm-2.1/</p></details> |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03505v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes.

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods.

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review of deep learning for photoacoustic imaging</p></details> |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.04997v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |
