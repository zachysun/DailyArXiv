| **[TKAN: Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07344v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have revolutionized many areas of machine learning, particularly in natural language and data sequence processing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02486v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing complex temporal patterns and relationships within multivariate data streams is a difficult task. We propose the Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (TKAT), a novel attention-based architecture designed to address this task using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). Inspired by the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), TKAT emerges as a powerful encoder-decoder model tailored to handle tasks in which the observed part of the features is more important than the a priori known part. This new architecture combined the theoretical foundation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with the power of transformers. TKAT aims to simplify the complex dependencies inherent in time series, making them more "interpretable". The use of transformer architecture in this framework allows us to capture long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.07344</p></details> |
| **[cDVGAN: One Flexible Model for Multi-class Gravitational Wave Signal and Glitch Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16356v4)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating realistic time-domain observations of gravitational waves (GWs) and GW detector glitches can help in advancing GW data analysis. Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Position: Quo Vadis, Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02678v3)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current state of machine learning scholarship in Timeseries Anomaly Detection (TAD) is plagued by the persistent use of flawed evaluation metrics, inconsistent benchmarking practices, and a lack of proper justification for the choices made in novel deep learning-based model designs. Our paper presents a critical analysis of the status quo in TAD, revealing the misleading track of current research and highlighting problematic methods, and evaluation practices. Our position advocates for a shift in focus from solely pursuing novel model designs to improving benchmarking practices, creating non-trivial datasets, and critically evaluating the utility of complex methods against simpler baselines. Our findings demonstrate the need for rigorous evaluation protocols, the creation of simple baselines, and the revelation that state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection models effectively learn linear mappings. These findings suggest the need for more exploration and development of simple and interpretable TAD methods. The increment of model complexity in the state-of-the-art deep-learning based models unfortunately offers very little improvement. We offer insights and suggestions for the field to move forward.

| **[A Combination Model Based on Sequential General Variational Mode Decomposition Method for Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03157v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of financial time series is a key concern for market economy makers and investors. The article selects online store sales and Australian beer sales as representatives of non-stationary, trending, and seasonal financial time series, and constructs a new SGVMD-ARIMA combination model in a non-linear combination way to predict financial time series. The ARIMA model, LSTM model, and other classic decomposition prediction models are used as control models to compare the accuracy of different models. The empirical results indicate that the constructed combination prediction model has universal advantages over the single prediction model and linear combination prediction model of the control group. Within the prediction interval, our proposed combination model has improved advantages over traditional decomposition prediction control group models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Combination Model for Time Series Prediction using LSTM via Extracting Dynamic Features Based on Spatial Smoothing and Sequential General Variational Mode Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03144v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to solve the problems such as difficult to extract effective features and low accuracy of sales volume prediction caused by complex relationships such as market sales volume in time series prediction, we proposed a time series prediction method of market sales volume based on Sequential General VMD and spatial smoothing Long short-term memory neural network (SS-LSTM) combination model. Firstly, the spatial smoothing algorithm is used to decompose and calculate the sample data of related industry sectors affected by the linkage effect of market sectors, extracting modal features containing information via Sequential General VMD on overall market and specific price trends; Then, according to the background of different Market data sets, LSTM network is used to model and predict the price of fundamental data and modal characteristics. The experimental results of data prediction with seasonal and periodic trends show that this method can achieve higher price prediction accuracy and more accurate accuracy in specific market contexts compared to traditional prediction methods Describe the changes in market sales volume.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting unobserved climate time series data at distant areas via spatial correlation using reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03061v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting time series data spatially distributed in many locations is often important for analyzing climate change and its impacts on ecosystems. However, comprehensive spatial data collection is not always feasible, requiring us to predict climate variables at some locations. This study focuses on a prediction of climatic elements, specifically near-surface temperature and pressure, at a target location apart from a data observation point. Our approach uses two prediction methods: reservoir computing (RC), known as a machine learning framework with low computational requirements, and vector autoregression models (VAR), recognized as a statistical method for analyzing time series data. Our results show that the accuracy of the predictions degrades with the distance between the observation and target locations. We quantitatively estimate the distance in which effective predictions are possible. We also find that in the context of climate data, a geographical distance is associated with data correlation, and a strong data correlation significantly improves the prediction accuracy with RC. In particular, RC outperforms VAR in predicting highly correlated data within the predictive range. These findings suggest that machine learning-based methods can be used more effectively to predict climatic elements in remote locations by assessing the distance to them from the data observation point in advance. Our study on low-cost and accurate prediction of climate variables has significant value for climate change strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUSU: A Multi-temporal-source Land Use Change Segmentation Dataset for Fine-grained Urban Semantic Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19055v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine urban change segmentation using multi-temporal remote sensing images is essential for understanding human-environment interactions in urban areas. Despite advances in remote sensing data for urban monitoring, coarse-grained classification systems and the lack of continuous temporal observations hinder the application of deep learning to urban change analysis. To address this, we introduce FUSU, a multi-source, multi-temporal change segmentation dataset for Fine-grained Urban Semantic Understanding. FUSU features the most detailed land use classification system to date, with 17 classes and 30 billion pixels of annotations. It includes bi-temporal high-resolution satellite images with 20-50 cm ground sample distance and monthly optical and radar satellite time series, covering 847 km2 across five urban areas in China. The fine-grained pixel-wise annotations and high spatial-temporal resolution data provide a robust foundation for deep learning models to understand urbanization and land use changes. To fully leverage FUSU, we propose a unified time-series architecture for both change detection and segmentation and then benchmark FUSU on various methods for several tasks. Dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/yuanshuai0914/FUSU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Filtered not Mixed: Stochastic Filtering-Based Online Gating for Mixture of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02969v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MoE-F -- a formalised mechanism for combining $N$ pre-trained expert Large Language Models (LLMs) in online time-series prediction tasks by adaptively forecasting the best weighting of LLM predictions at every time step. Our mechanism leverages the conditional information in each expert's running performance to forecast the best combination of LLMs for predicting the time series in its next step. Diverging from static (learned) Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods, MoE-F employs time-adaptive stochastic filtering techniques to combine experts. By framing the expert selection problem as a finite state-space, continuous-time Hidden Markov model (HMM), we can leverage the Wohman-Shiryaev filter. Our approach first constructs $N$ parallel filters corresponding to each of the $N$ individual LLMs. Each filter proposes its best combination of LLMs, given the information that they have access to. Subsequently, the $N$ filter outputs are aggregated to optimize a lower bound for the loss of the aggregated LLMs, which can be optimized in closed-form, thus generating our ensemble predictor. Our contributions here are: (I) the MoE-F algorithm -- deployable as a plug-and-play filtering harness, (II) theoretical optimality guarantees of the proposed filtering-based gating algorithm, and (III) empirical evaluation and ablative results using state of the art foundational and MoE LLMs on a real-world Financial Market Movement task where MoE-F attains a remarkable 17% absolute and 48.5% relative F1 measure improvement over the next best performing individual LLM expert.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 Appendix sections</p></details> |
| **[CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02131v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

However, it is difficult to accurately reproduce the long-term target time series because the reservoir system becomes unstable. This predictive capability is required for a wide variety of time-series processing, including predictions of motor timing and chaotic dynamical systems. This study proposes oscillation-driven reservoir computing (ODRC) with feedback, where oscillatory signals are fed into a reservoir network to stabilize the network activity and induce complex reservoir dynamics. The ODRC can reproduce long-term target time series more accurately than conventional reservoir computing methods in a motor timing and chaotic time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, it generates a time series similar to the target in the unexperienced period, that is, it can learn the abstract generative rules from limited observations. Given these significant improvements made by the simple and computationally inexpensive implementation, the ODRC would serve as a practical model of various time series data. Moreover, we will discuss biological implications of the ODRC, considering it as a model of neural oscillations and their cerebellar processors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Diffusion: A Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Stochastic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02827v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models have paved the way for significant progress in image, text and audio generation, leading to their applications in generative time series forecasting. However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Temporal Graph Learning Recurrent Neural Network for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02726v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial research topic in transportation management. However, it is a challenging problem due to rapidly changing traffic conditions, high nonlinearity of traffic flow, and complex spatial and temporal correlations of road networks. Most existing studies either try to capture the spatial dependencies between roads using the same semantic graph over different time steps, or assume all sensors on the roads are equally likely to be connected regardless of the distance between them. However, we observe that the spatial dependencies between roads indeed change over time, and two distant roads are not likely to be helpful to each other when predicting the traffic flow, both of which limit the performance of existing studies. In this paper, we propose Temporal Graph Learning Recurrent Neural Network (TGLRN) to address these problems. More precisely, to effectively model the nature of time series, we leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to dynamically construct a graph at each time step, thereby capturing the time-evolving spatial dependencies between roads (i.e., microscopic view). Simultaneously, we provide the Adaptive Structure Information to the model, ensuring that close and consecutive sensors are considered to be more important for predicting the traffic flow (i.e., macroscopic view). Furthermore, to endow TGLRN with robustness, we introduce an edge sampling strategy when constructing the graph at each time step, which eventually leads to further improvements on the model performance. Experimental results on four commonly used real-world benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of TGLRN.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Open-Source Tool for Mapping War Destruction at Scale in Ukraine using Sentinel-1 Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02506v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access to detailed war impact assessments is crucial for humanitarian organizations to effectively assist populations most affected by armed conflicts. However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in conflicts that cover vast territories and extend over long periods. This study presents a scalable and transferable method for estimating war-induced damage to buildings. We first train a machine learning model to output pixel-wise probability of destruction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite image time series, leveraging existing, manual damage assessments as ground truth and cloud-based geospatial analysis tools for large-scale inference. We further post-process these assessments using open building footprints to obtain a final damage estimate per building. We introduce an accessible, open-source tool that allows users to adjust the confidence interval based on their specific requirements and use cases. Our approach enables humanitarian organizations and other actors to rapidly screen large geographic regions for war impacts. We provide two publicly accessible dashboards: a Ukraine Damage Explorer to dynamically view our pre-computed estimates, and a Rapid Damage Mapping Tool to easily run our method and produce custom maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series: Bridging Predictive Power and Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02496v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is a groundbreaking model recently proposed by the MIT team, representing a revolutionary approach with the potential to be a game-changer in the field. This innovative concept has rapidly garnered worldwide interest within the AI community. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN utilizes spline-parametrized univariate functions in place of traditional linear weights, enabling them to dynamically learn activation patterns and significantly enhancing interpretability. In this paper, we explore the application of KAN to time series forecasting and propose two variants: T-KAN and MT-KAN. T-KAN is designed to detect concept drift within time series and can explain the nonlinear relationships between predictions and previous time steps through symbolic regression, making it highly interpretable in dynamically changing environments. MT-KAN, on the other hand, improves predictive performance by effectively uncovering and leveraging the complex relationships among variables in multivariate time series. Experiments validate the effectiveness of these approaches, demonstrating that T-KAN and MT-KAN significantly outperform traditional methods in time series forecasting tasks, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also improving model interpretability. This research opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, highlighting the potential of KAN as a powerful and interpretable tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Survival Analysis with Controlled Latent States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17077v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of learning individual-specific intensities of counting processes from a set of static variables and irregularly sampled time series. We introduce a novel modelization approach in which the intensity is the solution to a controlled differential equation. We first design a neural estimator by building on neural controlled differential equations. In a second time, we show that our model can be linearized in the signature space under sufficient regularity conditions, yielding a signature-based estimator which we call CoxSig. We provide theoretical learning guarantees for both estimators, before showcasing the performance of our models on a vast array of simulated and real-world datasets from finance, predictive maintenance and food supply chain management.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[On the Identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15925v4)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identifiability of latent variable models has received increasing attention due to its relevance in interpretability and out-of-distribution generalisation. In this work, we study the identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems, taking an initial step toward extending identifiability analysis to sequential latent variable models. We first prove the identifiability of Markov Switching Models, which commonly serve as the prior distribution for the continuous latent variables in Switching Dynamical Systems. We present identification conditions for first-order Markov dependency structures, whose transition distribution is parametrised via non-linear Gaussians. We then establish the identifiability of the latent variables and non-linear mappings in Switching Dynamical Systems up to affine transformations, by leveraging identifiability analysis techniques from identifiable deep latent variable models. We finally develop estimation algorithms for identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems. Throughout empirical studies, we demonstrate the practicality of identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems for segmenting high-dimensional time series such as videos, and showcase the use of identifiable Markov Switching Models for regime-dependent causal discovery in climate data.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[A Survey of Transformer Enabled Time Series Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02322v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has received much attention in the image and language domains, with the transformer neural network continuing to dominate the state of the art. Application of these models to time series generation is less explored, however, and is of great utility to machine learning, privacy preservation, and explainability research. The present survey identifies this gap at the intersection of the transformer, generative AI, and time series data, and reviews works in this sparsely populated subdomain. The reviewed works show great variety in approach, and have not yet converged on a conclusive answer to the problems the domain poses. GANs, diffusion models, state space models, and autoencoders were all encountered alongside or surrounding the transformers which originally motivated the survey. While too open a domain to offer conclusive insights, the works surveyed are quite suggestive, and several recommendations for best practice, and suggestions of valuable future work, are provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[PeFAD: A Parameter-Efficient Federated Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02318v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of mobile sensing techniques, huge amounts of time series data are generated and accumulated in various domains, fueling plenty of real-world applications. In this setting, time series anomaly detection is practically important. It endeavors to identify deviant samples from the normal sample distribution in time series. Existing approaches generally assume that all the time series is available at a central location. However, we are witnessing the decentralized collection of time series due to the deployment of various edge devices. To bridge the gap between the decentralized time series data and the centralized anomaly detection algorithms, we propose a Parameter-efficient Federated Anomaly Detection framework named PeFAD with the increasing privacy concerns. PeFAD for the first time employs the pre-trained language model (PLM) as the body of the client's local model, which can benefit from its cross-modality knowledge transfer capability. To reduce the communication overhead and local model adaptation cost, we propose a parameter-efficient federated training module such that clients only need to fine-tune small-scale parameters and transmit them to the server for update. PeFAD utilizes a novel anomaly-driven mask selection strategy to mitigate the impact of neglected anomalies during training. A knowledge distillation operation on a synthetic privacy-preserving dataset that is shared by all the clients is also proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue across clients. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real datasets, where PeFAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines by up to 28.74\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2024 (Research Track)</p></details> |
| **[Generative Pre-Trained Diffusion Paradigm for Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02212v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, generative pre-trained paradigms such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) have achieved revolutionary advancements and widespread real-world applications. Particularly, the emergence of pre-trained LLMs-based temporal works, compared to previous deep model approaches, has demonstrated superior generalization and robustness, showcasing the potential of generative pre-trained paradigms as foundation models for time series. However, those LLMs-based works mainly focus on cross-modal research, i.e., leveraging the language capabilities of LLMs in time series contexts. Although they have achieved impressive performance, there still exist the issues of concept drift caused by differences in data distribution and inflexibility caused by misalignment of dimensions. To this end, inspired by recent work on LVMs, we reconsider the paradigm of time series modeling. In this paper, we comprehensively explore, for the first time, the effectiveness and superiority of the Generative Pre-trained Diffusion (GPD) paradigm in real-world multivariate time series forecasting (TSF). Specifically, to mitigate performance bias introduced by sophisticated networks, we propose a straightforward MLP diffusion network for unconditional modeling of time series. Then we employ a zero-shot and tuning-free method to predict (generate) future data using historical data as prompts. The GPD paradigm is established on the time series modality, effectively preventing the phenomenon of concept drift, and enabling flexible forecasting of arbitrary lengths. We demonstrate that the GPD paradigm achieves comprehensive performance and generalization comparable to current SOTA LLM-based and deep model paradigms on mainstream benchmarks and various TSF tasks. Extensive experiments validate the potential of the GPD paradigm and its assistance in future related research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM. Code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/thuml/Large-Time-Series-Model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Common Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02001v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new notion $R_\ell$ of higher-order common information, which quantifies the information that $\ell\geq 2$ arbitrarily distributed random variables have in common. We provide analytical lower bounds on $R_3$ and $R_4$ for jointly Gaussian distributed sources and provide computable lower bounds for $R_\ell$ for any $\ell$ and any sources. We also provide a practical method to estimate the lower bounds on, e.g., real-world time-series data. As an example, we consider EEG data acquired in a setup with competing acoustic stimuli. We demonstrate that $R_3$ has descriptive properties that is not in $R_2$. Moreover, we observe a linear relationship between the amount of common information $R_3$ communicated from the acoustic stimuli and to the brain and the corresponding cortical activity in terms of neural tracking of the envelopes of the stimuli.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Evidentially Calibrated Source-Free Time-Series Domain Adaptation with Temporal Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02635v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model pre-trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data, preserving the source domain's privacy. While SFDA is prevalent in computer vision, it remains largely unexplored in time series analysis. Existing SFDA methods, designed for visual data, struggle to capture the inherent temporal dynamics of time series, hindering adaptation performance. This paper proposes MAsk And imPUte (MAPU), a novel and effective approach for time series SFDA. MAPU addresses the critical challenge of temporal consistency by introducing a novel temporal imputation task. This task involves randomly masking time series signals and leveraging a dedicated temporal imputer to recover the original signal within the learned embedding space, bypassing the complexities of noisy raw data. Notably, MAPU is the first method to explicitly address temporal consistency in the context of time series SFDA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with existing SFDA methods, providing greater flexibility. We further introduce E-MAPU, which incorporates evidential uncertainty estimation to address the overconfidence issue inherent in softmax predictions. To achieve that, we leverage evidential deep learning to obtain a better-calibrated pre-trained model and adapt the target encoder to map out-of-support target samples to a new feature representation closer to the source domain's support. This fosters better alignment, ultimately enhancing adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world time series datasets demonstrate that both MAPU and E-MAPU achieve significant performance gains compared to existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for tackling various time series domain adaptation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Convolutional Forecasting Network Based on Time Series Feature-Driven](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12038v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world scenarios contain a substantial amount of nonlinear information, which significantly interferes with the training process of models, leading to decreased prediction performance. Therefore, during the time series forecasting process, extracting the local and global time series patterns and understanding the potential nonlinear features among different time observations are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information at different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture potential nonlinear features among time observations. Building upon this, we propose ACNet, an adaptive convolutional network designed to effectively model the local and global temporal dependencies and the nonlinear features between observations in multivariate time series. Specifically, by extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, we capture both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed nonlinear feature adaptive extraction module captures the nonlinear features among different time observations in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ACNet across twelve real-world datasets.

| **[CAFO: Feature-Centric Explanation on Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01833v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series (MTS) classification, finding the important features (e.g., sensors) for model performance is crucial yet challenging due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of MTS data, intricate temporal dynamics, and the necessity for domain-specific interpretations. Current explanation methods for MTS mostly focus on time-centric explanations, apt for pinpointing important time periods but less effective in identifying key features. This limitation underscores the pressing need for a feature-centric approach, a vital yet often overlooked perspective that complements time-centric analysis. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel feature-centric explanation and evaluation framework for MTS, named CAFO (Channel Attention and Feature Orthgonalization). CAFO employs a convolution-based approach with channel attention mechanisms, incorporating a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) and a QR decomposition-based loss for promoting feature-wise orthogonality. We demonstrate that this orthogonalization enhances the separability of attention distributions, thereby refining and stabilizing the ranking of feature importance. This improvement in feature-wise ranking enhances our understanding of feature explainability in MTS. Furthermore, we develop metrics to evaluate global and class-specific feature importance. Our framework's efficacy is validated through extensive empirical analyses on two major public benchmarks and real-world datasets, both synthetic and self-collected, specifically designed to highlight class-wise discriminative features. The results confirm CAFO's robustness and informative capacity in assessing feature importance in MTS classification tasks. This study not only advances the understanding of feature-centric explanations in MTS but also sets a foundation for future explorations in feature-centric explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD 2024 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Heracles: A Hybrid SSM-Transformer Model for High-Resolution Image and Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18063v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized image modeling tasks with adaptations like DeIT, Swin, SVT, Biformer, STVit, and FDVIT. However, these models often face challenges with inductive bias and high quadratic complexity, making them less efficient for high-resolution images. State space models (SSMs) such as Mamba, V-Mamba, ViM, and SiMBA offer an alternative to handle high resolution images in computer vision tasks. These SSMs encounter two major issues. First, they become unstable when scaled to large network sizes. Second, although they efficiently capture global information in images, they inherently struggle with handling local information. To address these challenges, we introduce Heracles, a novel SSM that integrates a local SSM, a global SSM, and an attention-based token interaction module. Heracles leverages a Hartely kernel-based state space model for global image information, a localized convolutional network for local details, and attention mechanisms in deeper layers for token interactions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Heracles-C-small achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset with 84.5\% top-1 accuracy. Heracles-C-Large and Heracles-C-Huge further improve accuracy to 85.9\% and 86.4\%, respectively. Additionally, Heracles excels in transfer learning tasks on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford Flowers, and Stanford Cars, and in instance segmentation on the MSCOCO dataset. Heracles also proves its versatility by achieving state-of-the-art results on seven time-series datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize across domains with spectral data, capturing both local and global information.

Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon.

The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2307.04131</p></details> |

Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions, particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |

We consider here two abstractions: the extended summary causal graph, which conflates all lagged causal relations but distinguishes between lagged and instantaneous relations, and the summary causal graph which does not give any indication about the lag between causal relations. We show that the total effect is always identifiable in extended summary causal graphs and provide sufficient conditions for identifiability in summary causal graphs. We furthermore provide adjustment sets allowing to estimate the total effect whenever it is identifiable.</p></details> |  |

To better understand this phenomenon, we start by studying a toy linear forecasting problem for which we show that transformers are incapable of converging to their true solution despite their high expressive power. We further identify the attention of transformers as being responsible for this low generalization capacity. Building upon this insight, we propose a shallow lightweight transformer model that successfully escapes bad local minima when optimized with sharpness-aware optimization. We empirically demonstrate that this result extends to all commonly used real-world multivariate time series datasets. In particular, SAMformer surpasses current state-of-the-art methods and is on par with the biggest foundation model MOIRAI while having significantly fewer parameters.

At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than *1k* parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data. The code is publicly available at this repository: https://github.com/lss-1138/SparseTSF.</p></details> |  |

We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain, and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the reservoirs, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights using random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Stochastic Optimal Control for Diffusion Bridges in Function Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20630v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Schrödinger Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04795v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

However, the MLLM catastrophically forgets the text-only instructions, which do not include images and can be addressed within the initial LLM. In this paper, we present Wings, a novel MLLM that excels in both text-only dialogues and multimodal comprehension. Analyzing MLLM attention in multimodal instructions reveals that text-only forgetting is related to the attention shifts from pre-image to post-image text. From that, we construct extra modules that act as the boosted learner to compensate for the attention shift. The complementary visual and textual learners, like "wings" on either side, are connected in parallel within each layer's attention block. Initially, image and text inputs are aligned with visual learners operating alongside the main attention, balancing focus on visual elements. Textual learners are later collaboratively integrated with attention-based routing to blend the outputs of the visual and textual learners. We design the Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA) to guarantee high efficiency for learners. Our experimental results demonstrate that Wings outperforms equally-scaled MLLMs in both text-only and visual question-answering tasks. On a newly constructed Interleaved Image-Text (IIT) benchmark, Wings exhibits superior performance from text-only-rich to multimodal-rich question-answering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing LLM Behavior in Dialogue Summarization: Unveiling Circumstantial Hallucination Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03487v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization systems. However, they continue to face concerns about hallucinations. While prior work has evaluated LLMs extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap in our understanding of their faithfulness. Our work benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue summarization, using human annotations and focusing on identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies. Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is less prevalent in older models. We propose a refined taxonomy of errors, coining the category of "Circumstantial Inference" to bucket these LLM behaviors and release the dataset. Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models. Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors. To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for fine-grained error detection that outperform existing metrics, particularly for identifying "Circumstantial Inference."</p></details> | Accepted at ACL 2024 |

Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training framework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the resulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize reinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate the confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence predictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental results in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and maintaining the task performance. We show that the generated self-reflective rationales are reasonable and can further contribute to the calibration.

| **[Cycles of Thought: Measuring LLM Confidence through Stable Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03441v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many high-risk machine learning applications it is essential for a model to indicate when it is uncertain about a prediction. While large language models (LLMs) can reach and even surpass human-level accuracy on a variety of benchmarks, their overconfidence in incorrect responses is still a well-documented failure mode. Traditional methods for ML uncertainty quantification can be difficult to directly adapt to LLMs due to the computational cost of implementation and closed-source nature of many models. A variety of black-box methods have recently been proposed, but these often rely on heuristics such as self-verbalized confidence. We instead propose a framework for measuring an LLM's uncertainty with respect to the distribution of generated explanations for an answer. While utilizing explanations is not a new idea in and of itself, by interpreting each possible model+explanation pair as a test-time classifier we can calculate a posterior answer distribution over the most likely of these classifiers. We demonstrate how a specific instance of this framework using explanation entailment as our classifier likelihood improves confidence score metrics (in particular AURC and AUROC) over baselines across five different datasets. We believe these results indicate that our framework is both a well-principled and effective way of quantifying uncertainty in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

A better understanding of LLM capabilities on real world tasks is vital for safe development. Designing adequate LLM benchmarks is challenging: Data from real-world tasks is hard to collect, public availability of static evaluation data results in test data contamination and benchmark overfitting, and periodically generating new evaluation data is tedious and may result in temporally inconsistent results. We introduce HelloFresh, based on continuous streams of real-world data generated by intrinsically motivated human labelers. It covers recent events from X (formerly Twitter) community notes and edits of Wikipedia pages, mitigating the risk of test data contamination and benchmark overfitting. Any X user can propose an X note to add additional context to a misleading post (formerly tweet); if the community classifies it as helpful, it is shown with the post. Similarly, Wikipedia relies on community-based consensus, allowing users to edit articles or revert edits made by other users. Verifying whether an X note is helpful or whether a Wikipedia edit should be accepted are hard tasks that require grounding by querying the web. We backtest state-of-the-art LLMs supplemented with simple web search access and find that HelloFresh yields a temporally consistent ranking. To enable continuous evaluation on HelloFresh, we host a public leaderboard and periodically updated evaluation data at https://tinyurl.com/hello-fresh-LLM.</p></details> | ACL 2024 Findings |

However, existing methods predominantly rely on memorizing the updated knowledge, impeding LLMs from effectively combining the new knowledge with their inherent knowledge when answering questions. To this end, we propose a Learning to Edit (LTE) framework, focusing on teaching LLMs to apply updated knowledge into input questions, inspired by the philosophy of "Teach a man to fish." LTE features a two-phase process: (i) the Alignment Phase, which fine-tunes LLMs on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to make reliable, in-scope edits while preserving out-of-scope information and linguistic proficiency; and (ii) the Inference Phase, which employs a retrieval-based mechanism for real-time and mass knowledge editing. By comparing our approach with seven advanced baselines across four popular knowledge editing benchmarks and two LLM architectures, we demonstrate LTE's superiority in knowledge editing performance, robustness in both batch and sequential editing, minimal interference on general tasks, and rapid editing speeds. The data and code are available at https://github.com/YJiangcm/LTE.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables.

Such platforms usually rely both on users and on automated detection tools to flag inappropriate arguments of other users, which moderators then review. However, this kind of post-hoc moderation is expensive and time-consuming, and moderators are often overwhelmed by the amount and severity of flagged content. Instead, a promising alternative is to prevent negative behavior during content creation. This paper studies how inappropriate language in arguments can be computationally mitigated. We propose a reinforcement learning-based rewriting approach that balances content preservation and appropriateness based on existing classifiers, prompting an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as our initial policy. Unlike related style transfer tasks, rewriting inappropriate arguments allows deleting and adding content permanently. It is therefore tackled on document level rather than sentence level. We evaluate different weighting schemes for the reward function in both absolute and relative human assessment studies. Systematic experiments on non-parallel data provide evidence that our approach can mitigate the inappropriateness of arguments while largely preserving their content. It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, including few-shot learning, prompting, and humans.</p></details> |  |

With novel transformer based Generative AI methods, building chatbots have become trivial. Chatbots which are targeted at specific domains such as medicine, psychology, and general information retrieval are implemented rapidly. This, however, should not distract from the need to evaluate the chatbot responses. Especially because the natural language generation community does not entirely agree upon how to effectively evaluate such applications. With this work we discuss the issue further with the increasingly popular LLM based evaluations and how they correlate with human evaluations. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive factored evaluation mechanism that can be utilized in conjunction with both human and LLM-based evaluations. We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation. Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches, primarily relying on numerical models, face challenges in spatial-temporal resolution and in capturing the dynamic interplay of environmental, social, and behavioral factors affecting heat risks. This has led to difficulties in translating risk assessments into effective mitigation actions. Recognizing these problems, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the burgeoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract rich and contextual insights from news reports. We hence propose an LLM-empowered visual analytics system, Havior, that integrates the precise, data-driven insights of numerical models with nuanced news report information. This hybrid approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of heat risks and better identification, assessment, and mitigation of heat-related threats. The system incorporates novel visualization designs, such as "thermoglyph" and news glyph, enhancing intuitive understanding and analysis of heat risks. The integration of LLM-based techniques also enables advanced information retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction that can be guided by experts' analytics needs. Our case studies on two cities that faced significant heatwave events and interviews with five experts have demonstrated the usefulness of our system in providing in-depth and actionable insights for heat risk management.</p></details> |  |

When merely producing parallel sentences, their patterns are too simplistic to be valuable as a corpus. To address this issue, we propose an automated framework that includes a Subject Selector, Grammar Selector, Prompt Manager, and Evaluator. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset for GEC tasks, named \textbf{ChatLang-8}, which encompasses eight types of subject nouns and 23 types of grammar. It consists of 1 million pairs featuring human-like grammatical errors. Our experiments reveal that ChatLang-8 exhibits a more uniform pattern composition compared to existing GEC datasets. Furthermore, we observe improved model performance when using ChatLang-8 instead of existing GEC datasets. The experimental results suggest that our framework and ChatLang-8 are valuable resources for enhancing ChatGPT's data generation capabilities.</p></details> | preprint |

The recent literature on uncertainty quantification of natural language generation (NLG) utilises a conventional natural language inference (NLI) classifier to measure the semantic dispersion of LLMs responses. These studies employ logits of NLI classifier for semantic clustering to estimate uncertainty. However, logits represent the probability of the predicted class and barely contain feature information for potential clustering. Alternatively, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) performs impressively in extracting image-text pair features and measuring their similarity. To extend its usability, we propose Contrastive Semantic Similarity, the CLIP-based feature extraction module to obtain similarity features for measuring uncertainty for text pairs. We apply this method to selective NLG, which detects and rejects unreliable generations for better trustworthiness of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments with three LLMs on several benchmark question-answering datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Results show that our proposed method performs better in estimating reliable responses of LLMs than comparable baselines.

However, this process carries a substantial risk of model misuse, potentially resulting in severe economic consequences for business owners. Thus, safeguarding the copyright of these customized models during LLM fine-tuning has become an urgent practical requirement, but there are limited existing solutions to provide such protection. To tackle this pressing issue, we propose a novel watermarking approach named ``Double-I watermark''. Specifically, based on the instruct-tuning data, two types of backdoor data paradigms are introduced with trigger in the instruction and the input, respectively. By leveraging LLM's learning capability to incorporate customized backdoor samples into the dataset, the proposed approach effectively injects specific watermarking information into the customized model during fine-tuning, which makes it easy to inject and verify watermarks in commercial scenarios. We evaluate the proposed "Double-I watermark" under various fine-tuning methods, demonstrating its harmlessness, robustness, uniqueness, imperceptibility, and validity through both quantitative and qualitative analyses.</p></details> |  |

Such representations are highly valuable but they are notoriously difficult to learn, especially when it comes to modelling perceptual and subjective features. Distilling conceptual spaces from Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising strategy, but existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained LLMs using relatively simple zero-shot strategies. We focus in particular on the task of ranking entities according to a given conceptual space dimension. Unfortunately, we cannot directly fine-tune LLMs on this task, because ground truth rankings for conceptual space dimensions are rare. We therefore use more readily available features as training data and analyse whether the ranking capabilities of the resulting models transfer to perceptual and subjective features. We find that this is indeed the case, to some extent, but having at least some perceptual and subjective features in the training data seems essential for achieving the best results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2024 (Findings)</p></details> |

We explore the role of calibration sets in PTQ, specifically their effect on hidden activations in various notable open-source LLMs. Calibration sets are crucial for evaluating activation magnitudes and identifying outliers, which can distort the quantization range and negatively impact performance. Our analysis reveals a marked contrast in quantization effectiveness across models. The older OPT model, upon which much of the quantization literature is based, shows significant performance deterioration and high susceptibility to outliers with varying calibration sets. In contrast, newer models like Llama-2 7B, Llama-3 8B, Command-R 35B, and Mistral 7B demonstrate strong robustness, with Mistral 7B showing near-immunity to outliers and stable activations. These findings suggest a shift in PTQ strategies might be needed. As advancements in pre-training methods reduce the relevance of outliers, there is an emerging need to reassess the fundamentals of current quantization literature. The emphasis should pivot towards optimizing inference speed, rather than primarily focusing on outlier preservation, to align with the evolving characteristics of state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Planned-Behaviour Workflow Elicits Few-Shot Mobility Generation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09836v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have brought revolutionary changes to many fields, but their performance in human behaviour generation has not yet been extensively explored. This gap likely emerges because the internal processes governing behavioral intentions cannot be solely explained by abstract reasoning. Instead, they are also influenced by a multitude of factors, including social norms and personal preference. Inspired by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), we develop a LLM workflow named Chain-of-Planned Behaviour (CoPB) for mobility behaviour generation, which reflects the important spatio-temporal dynamics of human activities. Through exploiting the cognitive structures of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour control in TPB, CoPB significantly enhance the ability of LLMs to reason the intention of next movement. Specifically, CoPB substantially reduces the error rate of mobility intention generation from 57.8% to 19.4%. To improve the scalability of the proposed CoPB workflow, we further explore the synergy between LLMs and mechanistic models. We find mechanistic mobility models, such as gravity model, can effectively map mobility intentions to physical mobility behaviours. The strategy of integrating CoPB with gravity model can reduce the token cost by 97.7% and achieve better performance simultaneously. Besides, the proposed CoPB workflow can facilitate GPT-4-turbo to automatically generate high quality labels for mobility behavior reasoning. We show such labels can be leveraged to fine-tune the smaller-scale, open source LLaMA 3-8B, which significantly reduces usage costs without sacrificing the quality of the generated behaviours.</p></details> |  |
| **[PyramidInfer: Pyramid KV Cache Compression for High-throughput LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12532v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable comprehension abilities but face challenges in GPU memory usage during inference, hindering their scalability for real-time applications like chatbots. To accelerate inference, we store computed keys and values (KV cache) in the GPU memory. Existing methods study the KV cache compression to reduce memory by pruning the pre-computed KV cache. However, they neglect the inter-layer dependency between layers and huge memory consumption in pre-computation. To explore these deficiencies, we find that the number of crucial keys and values that influence future generations decreases layer by layer and we can extract them by the consistency in attention weights. Based on the findings, we propose PyramidInfer, a method that compresses the KV cache by layer-wise retaining crucial context. PyramidInfer saves significant memory by computing fewer keys and values without sacrificing performance. Experimental results show PyramidInfer improves 2.2x throughput compared to Accelerate with over 54% GPU memory reduction in KV cache.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |

It also poses unprecedented challenges, with content hallucination emerging as a significant concern. Existing solutions often involve expensive and complex interventions during the training process. Moreover, some approaches emphasize problem disassembly while neglecting the crucial validation process, leading to performance degradation or limited applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Markov Chain-based multi-agent debate verification framework to enhance hallucination detection accuracy in concise claims. Our method integrates the fact-checking process, including claim detection, evidence retrieval, and multi-agent verification. In the verification stage, we deploy multiple agents through flexible Markov Chain-based debates to validate individual claims, ensuring meticulous verification outcomes. Experimental results across three generative tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over baselines.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Using a novel framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of several key approaches for this task, including few-shot prompting, supervised finetuning, and reinforcement learning (RL), utilising both GPT-4 and open source alternatives like LLama2-7B and Mistral-7B. Our findings reveal a large performance gap between GPT-4 and the open source models when using prompt-based strategies. However, we show how to bridge this gap with a careful combination of finetuning and RL alignment. Our best model, CALM (CEFR-Aligned Language Model), surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and other strategies, at only a fraction of the cost. We further validate the quality of our results through a small-scale human study.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art methods for constructing LLM agents adopt trained LLMs and further fine-tune them on data for the agent task. However, we show that such methods are vulnerable to our proposed backdoor attacks named BadAgent on various agent tasks, where a backdoor can be embedded by fine-tuning on the backdoor data. At test time, the attacker can manipulate the deployed LLM agents to execute harmful operations by showing the trigger in the agent input or environment. To our surprise, our proposed attack methods are extremely robust even after fine-tuning on trustworthy data. Though backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in natural language processing, to the best of our knowledge, we could be the first to study them on LLM agents that are more dangerous due to the permission to use external tools. Our work demonstrates the clear risk of constructing LLM agents based on untrusted LLMs or data. Our code is public at https://github.com/DPamK/BadAgent</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |
| **[Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03003v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are integral to various software workflows. Such languages offer domain-specific optimizations and abstractions that improve code readability and maintainability. However, leveraging these languages requires developers to rewrite existing code using the specific DSL's API. While large language models (LLMs) have shown some success in automatic code transpilation, none of them provide any functional correctness guarantees on the transpiled code. Another approach for automating this task is verified lifting, which relies on program synthesis to find programs in the target language that are functionally equivalent to the source language program. While several verified lifting tools have been developed for various application domains, they are specialized for specific source-target languages or require significant expertise in domain knowledge to make the search efficient. In this paper, leveraging recent advances in LLMs, we propose an LLM-based approach (LLMLift) to building verified lifting tools. We use the LLM's capabilities to reason about programs to translate a given program into its corresponding equivalent in the target language. Additionally, we use LLMs to generate proofs for functional equivalence. We develop lifting-based compilers for {\em four different} DSLs targeting different application domains. Our approach not only outperforms previous symbolic-based tools in both the number of benchmarks transpiled and transpilation time, but also requires significantly less effort to build.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hint of Thought prompting: an explainable and zero-shot approach to reasoning tasks with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11461v6)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a way of communicating with users and any LLMs like GPT or PaLM2, prompting becomes an increasingly important research topic for better utilization of LLMs. Although simple prompting performs well on single-step questions, it cannot permanently activate the correct knowledge path for multi-step reasoning tasks. The chain of thought (CoT), which often contains zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT, is a recently developed prompting method that can explain the reasoning process to the LLM and outperforms simple prompting in three challenging reasoning tasks, including arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel hint of thought (HoT) prompting with explainability and zero-shot generalization. First, it is decomposed into the following three steps: explainable sub-questions, logical reasoning, and answer extraction. Second, such three steps are sequentially ordered in the format of step-by-step hints, which can be easily adjusted and explained to different tasks. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our HoT prompting has a significant advantage on the zero-shot reasoning task compared to existing zero-shot CoT. We did zero-shot experiments on math tasks like GSM8K, ADDSUB, AQUA, SVAMP and commonsense tasks such as StrategyQA. In particular, the accuracy of the proposed HoT prompting is improved with GSM8K from 40.50% to 67.80%, with AQUA from 31.9% to 46.4%, with SVAMP from 63.7% to 76.9%, and with ADDSUB from 74.7% to 87.34%, respectively, which even defeats the competitive PoT approach on GSM8k, AQUA, and SVAMP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04247v4)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents, called scientific LLM agents, also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations to address these issues effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrE-Text: Training Language Models on Private Federated Data in the Age of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02958v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device training is currently the most common approach for training machine learning (ML) models on private, distributed user data. Despite this, on-device training has several drawbacks: (1) most user devices are too small to train large models on-device, (2) on-device training is communication- and computation-intensive, and (3) on-device training can be difficult to debug and deploy. To address these problems, we propose Private Evolution-Text (PrE-Text), a method for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic textual data. First, we show that across multiple datasets, training small models (models that fit on user devices) with PrE-Text synthetic data outperforms small models trained on-device under practical privacy regimes ($\epsilon=1.29$, $\epsilon=7.58$). We achieve these results while using 9$\times$ fewer rounds, 6$\times$ less client computation per round, and 100$\times$ less communication per round. Second, finetuning large models on PrE-Text's DP synthetic data improves large language model (LLM) performance on private data across the same range of privacy budgets. Altogether, these results suggest that training on DP synthetic data can be a better option than training a model on-device on private distributed data.

However, there still exists a significant gap between the reported performance and the practical effectiveness in real-world medical scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore the causes of this gap by employing a multifaceted examination schema to systematically probe the actual mastery of medical knowledge by current LLMs. Specifically, we develop a novel evaluation framework MultifacetEval to examine the degree and coverage of LLMs in encoding and mastering medical knowledge at multiple facets (comparison, rectification, discrimination, and verification) concurrently. Based on the MultifacetEval framework, we construct two multifaceted evaluation datasets: MultiDiseK (by producing questions from a clinical disease knowledge base) and MultiMedQA (by rephrasing each question from a medical benchmark MedQA into multifaceted questions). The experimental results on these multifaceted datasets demonstrate that the extent of current LLMs in mastering medical knowledge is far below their performance on existing medical benchmarks, suggesting that they lack depth, precision, and comprehensiveness in mastering medical knowledge. Consequently, current LLMs are not yet ready for application in real-world medical tasks.

However, the application of ZO fine-tuning in memory-constrained settings such as mobile phones and laptops is still challenging since full precision forward passes are infeasible. In this study, we address this limitation by integrating sparsity and quantization into ZO fine-tuning of LLMs. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of fine-tuning an extremely small subset of LLM parameters using ZO. This approach allows the majority of un-tuned parameters to be quantized to accommodate the constraint of limited device memory. Our findings reveal that the pre-training process can identify a set of "sensitive parameters" that can guide the ZO fine-tuning of LLMs on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning 0.1% sensitive parameters in the LLM with ZO can outperform the full ZO fine-tuning performance, while offering wall-clock time speedup. Additionally, we show that ZO fine-tuning targeting these 0.1% sensitive parameters, combined with 4 bit quantization, enables efficient ZO fine-tuning of an Llama2-7B model on a GPU device with less than 8 GiB of memory and notably reduced latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04511v3)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of the recent LLMs enable them to execute external function calls to overcome their inherent limitations, such as knowledge cutoffs, poor arithmetic skills, or lack of access to private data. This development has allowed LLMs to select and coordinate multiple functions based on the context to tackle more complex problems. However, current methods for function calling often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which can result in high latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior. To address this, we introduce LLMCompiler, which executes functions in parallel to efficiently orchestrate multiple function calls. Drawing inspiration from the principles of classical compilers, LLMCompiler enables parallel function calling with three components: (i) a Function Calling Planner, formulating execution plans for function calling; (ii) a Task Fetching Unit, dispatching function calling tasks; and (iii) an Executor, executing these tasks in parallel. LLMCompiler automatically generates an optimized orchestration for the function calls and can be used with both open-source and closed-source models. We have benchmarked LLMCompiler on a range of tasks with different patterns of function calling. We observe consistent latency speedup of up to 3.7x, cost savings of up to 6.7x, and accuracy improvement of up to ~9% compared to ReAct.

Despite the remarkable few-shot capabilities exhibited by black-box large language models (LLMs), the inherent opacity of their model parameters presents significant challenges in aligning the generated output with individual expectations. Existing solutions have primarily focused on prompt design to incorporate user-specific profiles and behaviors; however, such approaches often struggle to generalize effectively due to their inability to capture shared knowledge among all users. To address these challenges, we propose HYDRA, a model factorization framework that captures both user-specific behavior patterns from historical data and shared general knowledge among all users to deliver personalized generation. In order to capture user-specific behavior patterns, we first train a reranker to prioritize the most useful information from top-retrieved relevant historical records. By combining the prioritized history with the corresponding query, we train an adapter to align the output with individual user-specific preferences, eliminating the reliance on access to inherent model parameters of black-box LLMs. Both the reranker and the adapter can be decomposed into a base model with multiple user-specific heads, resembling a hydra. The base model maintains shared knowledge across users, while the multiple personal heads capture user-specific preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that HYDRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by an average relative improvement of 9.01% across five diverse personalization tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/night-chen/HYDRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, work in progress</p></details> |

Limits of LLM scaling based on human-generated data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04325v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the potential constraints on LLM scaling posed by the availability of public human-generated text data. We forecast the growing demand for training data based on current trends and estimate the total stock of public human text data. Our findings indicate that if current LLM development trends continue, models will be trained on datasets roughly equal in size to the available stock of public human text data between 2026 and 2032, or slightly earlier if models are overtrained. We explore how progress in language modeling can continue when human-generated text datasets cannot be scaled any further. We argue that synthetic data generation, transfer learning from data-rich domains, and data efficiency improvements might support further progress.</p></details> |  |

Human agents typically resolve user issues by following predefined workflows, decomposing workflow steps into actionable items, and performing actions by executing APIs in order; all of which require reasoning and planning. With the recent advances in LLMs, there have been increasing attempts to use them for task planning and API usage. However, the faithfulness of the plans to predefined workflows and API dependencies, is not guaranteed with LLMs. Moreover, workflows in real life are often custom-defined and prone to changes; hence, adaptation is desirable. To study this, we propose the problem of faithful planning in TODs that needs to resolve user intents by following predefined flows and preserving API dependencies. To solve this problem, we propose FLAP, a Flow-Adhering Planning algorithm based on constrained decoding with lookahead heuristic for LLMs. Our algorithm alleviates the need for finetuning LLMs using domain specific (plan/dependency) data, enables quick adaptation to predefined flows, and outperforms other decoding and prompting-based baselines. Further, our algorithm empowers smaller LLMs (7B) to perform at par larger LLMs (30B-40B).</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024 (Camera Ready) (fixed minor typos)</p></details> |

Most prior studies primarily focus on optimizing translation quality, with limited attention to understanding the specific aspects of ICL that influence the said quality. To this end, we perform the first of its kind, an exhaustive study of in-context learning for machine translation. We first establish that ICL is primarily example-driven and not instruction-driven. Following this, we conduct an extensive exploration of various aspects of the examples to understand their influence on downstream performance. Our analysis includes factors such as quality and quantity of demonstrations, spatial proximity, and source versus target originality. Further, we also investigate challenging scenarios involving indirectness and misalignment of examples to understand the limits of ICL. While we establish the significance of the quality of the target distribution over the source distribution of demonstrations, we further observe that perturbations sometimes act as regularizers, resulting in performance improvements. Surprisingly, ICL does not necessitate examples from the same task, and a related task with the same target distribution proves sufficient. We hope that our study acts as a guiding resource for considerations in utilizing ICL for MT.

While this approach is effective, it is time-consuming and error-prone for complex designs. Large language models (LLMs) are promising in automating HDL code generation. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can learn to generate code that compiles and is functionally accurate. We aim to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate functionally correct HDL models. We build AutoChip by combining the interactive capabilities of LLMs and the output from Verilog simulations to generate Verilog modules. We start with a design prompt for a module and the context from compilation errors and debugging messages, which highlight differences between the expected and actual outputs. This ensures that accurate Verilog code can be generated without human intervention. We evaluate AutoChip using problem sets from HDLBits. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the AutoChip using several LLMs and problem categories. The results show that incorporating context from compiler tools, such as Icarus Verilog, improves the effectiveness, yielding 24.20% more accurate Verilog.

Given a guideline expressed in suffix string and the model's self-assessment of adherence, Self-Control computes the gradient of this self-judgment concerning the model's hidden states, directly influencing the auto-regressive generation process towards desired behaviors. To enhance efficiency, we introduce Self-Control_{prefix}, a compact module that encapsulates the learned representations from suffix gradients into a Prefix Controller, facilitating inference-time control for various LLM behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate Self-Control's efficacy across multiple domains, including emotional modulation, ensuring harmlessness, and enhancing complex reasoning. Especially, Self-Control_{prefix} enables a plug-and-play control and jointly controls multiple attributes, improving model outputs without altering model parameters or increasing inference-time costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 12 figures, 61 tables; Website: https://llm-self-control.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[To Believe or Not to Believe Your LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02543v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs), with the goal to identify when uncertainty in responses given a query is large. We simultaneously consider both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, where the former comes from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (such as about facts or the language), and the latter comes from irreducible randomness (such as multiple possible answers). In particular, we derive an information-theoretic metric that allows to reliably detect when only epistemic uncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable. This condition can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtained simply by some special iterative prompting based on the previous responses. Such quantification, for instance, allows to detect hallucinations (cases when epistemic uncertainty is high) in both single- and multi-answer responses. This is in contrast to many standard uncertainty quantification strategies (such as thresholding the log-likelihood of a response) where hallucinations in the multi-answer case cannot be detected. We conduct a series of experiments which demonstrate the advantage of our formulation. Further, our investigations shed some light on how the probabilities assigned to a given output by an LLM can be amplified by iterative prompting, which might be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |

Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.17238 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[CheckEmbed: Effective Verification of LLM Solutions to Open-Ended Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02524v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing various domains, yet verifying their answers remains a significant challenge, especially for intricate open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and extraction of knowledge. In this work, we propose CheckEmbed: an accurate, scalable, and simple LLM verification approach. CheckEmbed is driven by a straightforward yet powerful idea: in order to compare LLM solutions to one another or to the ground-truth, compare their corresponding answer-level embeddings obtained with a model such as GPT Text Embedding Large. This reduces a complex textual answer to a single embedding, facilitating straightforward, fast, and meaningful verification. We develop a comprehensive verification pipeline implementing the CheckEmbed methodology. The CheckEmbed pipeline also comes with metrics for assessing the truthfulness of the LLM answers, such as embedding heatmaps and their summaries. We show how to use these metrics for deploying practical engines that decide whether an LLM answer is satisfactory or not. We apply the pipeline to real-world document analysis tasks, including term extraction and document summarization, showcasing significant improvements in accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and runtime performance compared to existing token-, sentence-, and fact-level schemes such as BERTScore or SelfCheckGPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Fine-tuning for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17197v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has recently garnered considerable attention, where fine-tuning plays a key role in LLMs' adaptation. However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expanding recommendation data limits their practical application. To address this challenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adapt LLMs to new recommendation data. We propose the task of data pruning for efficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samples tailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning. While coreset selection is closely related to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely on suboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scale recommendation data. To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process. To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores, i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of sample removal on the overall performance. To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score. Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs. Empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, the proposed method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[On the Intrinsic Self-Correction Capability of LLMs: Uncertainty and Latent Concept](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02378v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When these instructions lack specific details about the issues in the response, this is referred to as leveraging the intrinsic self-correction capability. The empirical success of self-correction can be found in various applications, e.g., text detoxification and social bias mitigation. However, leveraging this self-correction capability may not always be effective, as it has the potential to revise an initially correct response into an incorrect one. In this paper, we endeavor to understand how and why leveraging the self-correction capability is effective. We identify that appropriate instructions can guide LLMs to a convergence state, wherein additional self-correction steps do not yield further performance improvements. We empirically demonstrate that model uncertainty and activated latent concepts jointly characterize the effectiveness of self-correction. Furthermore, we provide a mathematical formulation indicating that the activated latent concept drives the convergence of the model uncertainty and self-correction performance. Our analysis can also be generalized to the self-correction behaviors observed in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Moreover, we highlight that task-agnostic debiasing can benefit from our principle in terms of selecting effective fine-tuning samples. Such initial success demonstrates the potential extensibility for better instruction tuning and safety alignment.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Retaining Key Information under High Compression Ratios: Query-Guided Compressor for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02376v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing popularity of Large Language Models has sparked interest in context compression for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the performance of previous methods degrades dramatically as compression ratios increase, sometimes even falling to the closed-book level. This decline can be attributed to the loss of key information during the compression process. Our preliminary study supports this hypothesis, emphasizing the significance of retaining key information to maintain model performance under high compression ratios. As a result, we introduce Query-Guided Compressor (QGC), which leverages queries to guide the context compression process, effectively preserving key information within the compressed context. Additionally, we employ a dynamic compression strategy. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed QGC on the Question Answering task, including NaturalQuestions, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA datasets. Experimental results show that QGC can consistently perform well even at high compression ratios, which also offers significant benefits in terms of inference cost and throughput.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[MEDIQ: Question-Asking LLMs for Adaptive and Reliable Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00922v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-stakes domains like clinical reasoning, AI assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) are yet to be reliable and safe. We identify a key obstacle towards reliability: existing LLMs are trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context in the prompt or insufficient parametric knowledge. We propose to change this paradigm to develop more careful LLMs that ask follow-up questions to gather necessary and sufficient information and respond reliably. We introduce MEDIQ, a framework to simulate realistic clinical interactions, which incorporates a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System. The Patient may provide incomplete information in the beginning; the Expert refrains from making diagnostic decisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details from the Patient via follow-up questions. To evaluate MEDIQ, we convert MEDQA and CRAFT-MD -- medical benchmarks for diagnostic question answering -- into an interactive setup. We develop a reliable Patient system and prototype several Expert systems, first showing that directly prompting state-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades the quality of clinical reasoning, indicating that adapting LLMs to interactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial. We then augment the Expert with a novel abstention module to better estimate model confidence and decide whether to ask more questions, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy by 20.3%; however, performance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound when full information is given upfront. Further analyses reveal that interactive performance can be improved by filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations. Overall, our paper introduces a novel problem towards LLM reliability, a novel MEDIQ framework, and highlights important future directions to extend the information-seeking abilities of LLM assistants in critical domains.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |

This approach allows for a nuanced assessment of the quality and diversity of generated text without the need for aligned corpora. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, the study reveals new insights into their performance on open-ended generation tasks, which are not adequately captured by traditional benchmarks. The findings highlight a trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated samples, particularly when models are fine-tuned on instruction dataset or with human feedback. This work extends the toolkit for distribution-based NLP evaluation, offering insights into the practical capabilities and challenges that current LLMs face in generating diverse and high-quality text.

| **[LLMs cannot find reasoning errors, but can correct them given the error location](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08516v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While self-correction has shown promise in improving LLM outputs in terms of style and quality (e.g. Chen et al., 2023b; Madaan et al., 2023), recent attempts to self-correct logical or reasoning errors often cause correct answers to become incorrect, resulting in worse performances overall (Huang et al., 2023). In this paper, we show that poor self-correction performance stems from LLMs' inability to find logical mistakes, rather than their ability to correct a known mistake. Firstly, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on their mistake-finding ability and demonstrate that they generally struggle with the task, even in highly objective, unambiguous cases. Secondly, we test the correction abilities of LLMs -- separately from mistake finding -- using a backtracking setup that feeds ground truth mistake location information to the model. We show that this boosts downstream task performance across our 5 reasoning tasks, indicating that LLMs' correction abilities are robust. Finally, we show that it is possible to obtain mistake location information without ground truth labels or in-domain training data. We train a small classifier with out-of-domain data, which exhibits stronger mistake-finding performance than prompting a large model. We release our dataset of LLM-generated logical mistakes, BIG-Bench Mistake, to enable further research into locating LLM reasoning mistakes.</p></details> | ACL 2024 Findings |

As LLM-driven agents learn to negotiate and act like real humans, how to evaluate agents' bargaining abilities remains an open problem. For the first time, we formally described the Bargaining task as an asymmetric incomplete information game, defining the gains of the Buyer and Seller in multiple bargaining processes. It allows us to quantitatively assess an agent's performance in the Bargain task. We collected a real product price dataset, AmazonHistoryPrice, and conducted evaluations of various LLM agents' bargaining abilities. We find that playing a Buyer is much harder than a Seller, and increasing model size can not effectively improve the Buyer's performance. To address the challenge, we propose a novel approach called OG-Narrator that integrates a deterministic Offer Generator to control the price range of Buyer's offers, and an LLM Narrator to create natural language sentences for generated offers. Experimental results show that OG-Narrator improves the buyer's deal rates from 26.67% to 88.88% and brings a ten times multiplication of profits on all baselines, even a model that has not been aligned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 Findings.

| **[Generating Query Recommendations via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19749v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query recommendation systems are ubiquitous in modern search engines, assisting users in producing effective queries to meet their information needs. However, these systems require a large amount of data to produce good recommendations, such as a large collection of documents to index and query logs. In particular, query logs and user data are not available in cold start scenarios. Query logs are expensive to collect and maintain and require complex and time-consuming cascading pipelines for creating, combining, and ranking recommendations. To address these issues, we frame the query recommendation problem as a generative task, proposing a novel approach called Generative Query Recommendation (GQR). GQR uses an LLM as its foundation and does not require to be trained or fine-tuned to tackle the query recommendation problem. We design a prompt that enables the LLM to understand the specific recommendation task, even using a single example. We then improved our system by proposing a version that exploits query logs called Retriever-Augmented GQR (RA-GQR). RA-GQr dynamically composes its prompt by retrieving similar queries from query logs. GQR approaches reuses a pre-existing neural architecture resulting in a simpler and more ready-to-market approach, even in a cold start scenario. Our proposed GQR obtains state-of-the-art performance in terms of NDCG@10 and clarity score against two commercial search engines and the previous state-of-the-art approach on the Robust04 and ClueWeb09B collections, improving on average the NDCG@10 performance up to ~4% on Robust04 and ClueWeb09B w.r.t the previous best competitor. RA-GQR further improve the NDCG@10 obtaining an increase of ~11%, ~6\% on Robust04 and ClueWeb09B w.r.t the best competitor. Furthermore, our system obtained ~59% of user preferences in a blind user study, proving that our method produces the most engaging queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gener...</summary><p>Generating Query Recommendations via LLMs</p></details> |

Interpretation of LLMs Hidden States in Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02060v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability and explainability of AI are becoming increasingly important in light of the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). This paper investigates the interpretation of LLMs in the context of the knowledge-based question answering. The main hypothesis of the study is that correct and incorrect model behavior can be distinguished at the level of hidden states. The quantized models LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B and the MuSeRC question-answering dataset are used to test this hypothesis. The results of the analysis support the proposed hypothesis. We also identify the layers which have a negative effect on the model's behavior. As a prospect of practical application of the hypothesis, we propose to train such "weak" layers additionally in order to improve the quality of the task solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for NLDB-2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[QROA: A Black-Box Query-Response Optimization Attack on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02044v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have surged in popularity in recent months, yet they possess concerning capabilities for generating harmful content when manipulated. This study introduces the Query-Response Optimization Attack (QROA), an optimization-based strategy designed to exploit LLMs through a black-box, query-only interaction. QROA adds an optimized trigger to a malicious instruction to compel the LLM to generate harmful content. Unlike previous approaches, QROA does not require access to the model's logit information or any other internal data and operates solely through the standard query-response interface of LLMs. Inspired by deep Q-learning and Greedy coordinate descent, the method iteratively updates tokens to maximize a designed reward function. We tested our method on various LLMs such as Vicuna, Falcon, and Mistral, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) over 80\%. We also tested the model against Llama2-chat, the fine-tuned version of Llama2 designed to resist Jailbreak attacks, achieving good ASR with a suboptimal initial trigger seed. This study demonstrates the feasibility of generating jailbreak attacks against deployed LLMs in the public domain using black-box optimization methods, enabling more comprehensive safety testing of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODA: Observation-Driven Agent for integrating LLMs and Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07677v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, existing methodologies that integrate LLMs and KGs often navigate the task-solving process solely based on the LLM's analysis of the question, overlooking the rich cognitive potential inherent in the vast knowledge encapsulated in KGs. To address this, we introduce Observation-Driven Agent (ODA), a novel AI agent framework tailored for tasks involving KGs. ODA incorporates KG reasoning abilities via global observation, which enhances reasoning capabilities through a cyclical paradigm of observation, action, and reflection. Confronting the exponential explosion of knowledge during observation, we innovatively design a recursive observation mechanism. Subsequently, we integrate the observed knowledge into the action and reflection modules. Through extensive experiments, ODA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, notably achieving accuracy improvements of 12.87% and 8.9%.</p></details> | LLM+KG |

Some methods train dedicated detectors on specific datasets but fall short in generalizing to unseen test data, while other zero-shot ones often yield suboptimal performance. Although the recent DetectGPT has shown promising detection performance, it suffers from significant inefficiency issues, as detecting a single candidate requires querying the source LLM with hundreds of its perturbations. This paper aims to bridge this gap. Concretely, we propose to incorporate a Bayesian surrogate model, which allows us to select typical samples based on Bayesian uncertainty and interpolate scores from typical samples to other samples, to improve query efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches under a low query budget. Notably, when detecting the text generated by LLaMA family models, our method with just 2 or 3 queries can outperform DetectGPT with 200 queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Logic Tree Extraction for Event Sequence Explanation from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01124v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern high-stakes systems, such as healthcare or robotics, often generate vast streaming event sequences. Our goal is to design an efficient, plug-and-play tool to elicit logic tree-based explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide customized insights into each observed event sequence. Built on the temporal point process model for events, our method employs the likelihood function as a score to evaluate generated logic trees. We propose an amortized Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning framework and treat the logic tree as latent variables. In the E-step, we evaluate the posterior distribution over the latent logic trees using an LLM prior and the likelihood of the observed event sequences. LLM provides a high-quality prior for the latent logic trees, however, since the posterior is built over a discrete combinatorial space, we cannot get the closed-form solution. We propose to generate logic tree samples from the posterior using a learnable GFlowNet, which is a diversity-seeking generator for structured discrete variables. The M-step employs the generated logic rules to approximate marginalization over the posterior, facilitating the learning of model parameters and refining the tunable LLM prior parameters. In the online setting, our locally built, lightweight model will iteratively extract the most relevant rules from LLMs for each sequence using only a few iterations. Empirical demonstrations showcase the promising performance and adaptability of our framework.</p></details> |  |

This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image restoration, which consists of three components, \textit{i.e.}, i) a pre-trained and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods.

We first propose an extrapolated DYS method to effectively solve a class of structural nonconvex optimization problems that involve minimizing the sum of three possible nonconvex functions. Our approach provides an algorithmic framework that encompasses both extrapolated forward-backward splitting and extrapolated Douglas-Rachford splitting methods. To establish the convergence of the proposed method, we rigorously analyze its behavior based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, subject to some tight parameter conditions. Moreover, we introduce two extrapolated PnP-DYS methods with convergence guarantee, where the traditional regularization prior is replaced by a gradient step-based denoiser. This denoiser is designed using a differentiable neural network and can be reformulated as the proximal operator of a specific nonconvex functional. We conduct extensive experiments on image deblurring and image super-resolution problems, where our results showcase the advantage of the extrapolation strategy and the superior performance of the learning-based model that incorporates the PnP denoiser in terms of achieving high-quality recovery images.</p></details> | 37 Pages |
| **[Deep Block Proximal Linearised Minimisation Algorithm for Non-convex Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02458v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is typically addressed through non-convex inverse problems, which are often solved using first-order block-wise splitting methods. In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 6 tables |

However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Matching Transformation Transformers for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00629v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the efficacy of learning large models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously. Nonetheless, these approaches introduce considerable computational overhead and complex learning paradigms, limiting their practical utility. In response, we propose \textit{DaAIR}, an efficient All-in-One image restorer employing a Degradation-aware Learner (DaLe) in the low-rank regime to collaboratively mine shared aspects and subtle nuances across diverse degradations, generating a degradation-aware embedding. By dynamically allocating model capacity to input degradations, we realize an efficient restorer integrating holistic and specific learning within a unified model. Furthermore, DaAIR introduces a cost-efficient parameter update mechanism that enhances degradation awareness while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive comparisons across five image degradations demonstrate that our DaAIR outperforms both state-of-the-art All-in-One models and degradation-specific counterparts, affirming our efficacy and practicality.

| **[Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17161v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.

| **[Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific restoration or enhancement problems, and do not fully explore the potential of utilizing multiple images. Motivated by the fact that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to unify image restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the Vision Transformers (ViTs) emergence has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR) tasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation operator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common characteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling process in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This choice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored image to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054v5)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

AutoDIR excels in its ability to automatically identify and restore images suffering from a range of unknown degradations. AutoDIR offers intuitive open-vocabulary image editing, empowering users to customize and enhance images according to their preferences. Specifically, AutoDIR consists of two key stages: a Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) stage based on a semantic-agnostic vision-language model which automatically detects unknown image degradations for input images, an All-in-One Image Restoration (AIR) stage utilizes structural-corrected latent diffusion which handles multiple types of image degradations. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that AutoDIR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for a wider range of image restoration tasks. The design of AutoDIR also enables flexible user control (via text prompt) and generalization to new tasks as a foundation model of image restoration.

| **[Fast Samplers for Inverse Problems in Iterative Refinement Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17673v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mandt-lab/CI2RM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Uncertainty Exploration via Feedforward Posterior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15719v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When solving ill-posed inverse problems, one often desires to explore the space of potential solutions rather than be presented with a single plausible reconstruction. Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using tree-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Blaze3DM: Marry Triplane Representation with Diffusion for 3D Medical Inverse Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15241v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving 3D medical inverse problems such as image restoration and reconstruction is crucial in modern medical field. However, the curse of dimensionality in 3D medical data leads mainstream volume-wise methods to suffer from high resource consumption and challenges models to successfully capture the natural distribution, resulting in inevitable volume inconsistency and artifacts. Some recent works attempt to simplify generation in the latent space but lack the capability to efficiently model intricate image details. To address these limitations, we present Blaze3DM, a novel approach that enables fast and high-fidelity generation by integrating compact triplane neural field and powerful diffusion model. In technique, Blaze3DM begins by optimizing data-dependent triplane embeddings and a shared decoder simultaneously, reconstructing each triplane back to the corresponding 3D volume. To further enhance 3D consistency, we introduce a lightweight 3D aware module to model the correlation of three vertical planes. Then, diffusion model is trained on latent triplane embeddings and achieves both unconditional and conditional triplane generation, which is finally decoded to arbitrary size volume. Extensive experiments on zero-shot 3D medical inverse problem solving, including sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, compressed-sensing MRI, and MRI isotropic super-resolution, demonstrate that Blaze3DM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also markedly improves computational efficiency over existing methods (22~40x faster than previous work).</p></details> |  |
| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v5)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these kinds of domain knowledge separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more in-depth long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. The SSUMamba can exploit complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Zigzag Scan (SSAZS) strategy for HSIs, which helps exploit the continuous information flow in multiple directions of 3-D characteristics within HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparison methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Visual State Space Model for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14343v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. ViTs typically yield superior results in image restoration compared to CNNs due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and input-dependent characteristics. However, the computational complexity of Transformer-based models grows quadratically with the image resolution, limiting their practical appeal in high-resolution image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) to visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on benchmark datasets and real-captured images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image super-resolution algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Traditional enhancement techniques often fail to adequately address issues like noise, color distortion, and detail loss in challenging lighting environments. Our approach leverages insights from the Retinex theory and recent advances in image restoration networks to develop a streamlined model that efficiently processes illumination components and integrates context-sensitive enhancements through optimized convolutional blocks. This results in significantly improved image clarity and color fidelity, while avoiding over-enhancement and unnatural color shifts. Crucially, our model is designed to be lightweight, ensuring low computational demand and suitability for real-time applications on standard consumer hardware. Performance evaluations confirm that our model not only surpasses existing methods in enhancing low-light images but also maintains a minimal computational footprint.</p></details> |  |

The unlabeled data consisting of both normal and abnormal data is not well explored. We introduce a novel Spatial-aware Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) for one-class semi-supervised generation of health images.Our core insight is the utilization of position encoding and attention to accurately focus on restoring abnormal regions and preserving normal regions. To fully utilize the unlabelled data, SAGAN relaxes the cyclic consistency requirement of the existing unpaired image-to-image conversion methods, and generates high-quality health images corresponding to unlabeled data, guided by the reconstruction of normal images and restoration of pseudo-anomaly images.Subsequently, the discrepancy between the generated healthy image and the original image is utilized as an anomaly score.Extensive experiments on three medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accept by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[A New Cross-Space Total Variation Regularization Model for Color Image Restoration with Quaternion Blur Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12114v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cross-channel deblurring problem in color image processing is difficult to solve due to the complex coupling and structural blurring of color pixels. Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color infection in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a sweet balance of regularization functionals on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color infection reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and manoeuvrability of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,10figures |
| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasizing Crucial Features for Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11468v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a challenging ill-posed problem which estimates latent sharp image from its degraded counterpart. Although the existing methods have achieved promising performance by designing novelty architecture of module, they ignore the fact that different regions in a corrupted image undergo varying degrees of degradation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework to adapt to varying degrees of degradation across different regions for image restoration. Specifically, we design a spatial and frequency attention mechanism (SFAM) to emphasize crucial features for restoration. SFAM consists of two modules: the spatial domain attention module (SDAM) and the frequency domain attention module (FDAM). The SFAM discerns the degradation location through spatial selective attention and channel selective attention in the spatial domain, while the FDAM enhances high-frequency signals to amplify the disparities between sharp and degraded image pairs in the spectral domain. Additionally, to capture global range information, we introduce a multi-scale block (MSBlock) that consists of three scale branches, each containing multiple simplified channel attention blocks (SCABlocks) and a multi-scale feed-forward block (MSFBlock). Finally, we propose our ECFNet, which integrates the aforementioned components into a U-shaped backbone for recovering high-quality images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECFNet, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253v3)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</p></details> |  |

However, in image restoration, the focus is on the mapping relationship from low-quality to high-quality images. Regarding this issue, we introduce the Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge (GOUB) model. By leveraging the natural mean-reverting property of the generalized OU process and further eliminating the variance of its steady-state distribution through the Doob's h-transform, we achieve diffusion mappings from point to point enabling the recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence shared by various bridge models, all of which are special instances of GOUB and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Additionally, we present the corresponding Mean-ODE model adept at capturing both pixel-level details and structural perceptions. Experimental outcomes showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by both models across diverse tasks, including inpainting, deraining, and super-resolution.

However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18. Expectedly, multimodal data can be integrated similarly, which opens up possibilities for conducting joint analyses with datasets spanning diverse domains in the era of multi-message astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures, to be published on Chinese Physics C</p></details> |
| **[Step-Calibrated Diffusion for Biomedical Optical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13680v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

| **[RSDehamba: Lightweight Vision Mamba for Remote Sensing Satellite Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10030v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image dehazing (RSID) aims to remove nonuniform and physically irregular haze factors for high-quality image restoration. The emergence of CNNs and Transformers has taken extraordinary strides in the RSID arena. However, these methods often struggle to demonstrate the balance of adequate long-range dependency modeling and maintaining computational efficiency. To this end, we propose the first lightweight network on the mamba-based model called RSDhamba in the field of RSID. Greatly inspired by the recent rise of Selective State Space Model (SSM) for its superior performance in modeling linear complexity and remote dependencies, our designed RSDehamba integrates the SSM framework into the U-Net architecture. Specifically, we propose the Vision Dehamba Block (VDB) as the core component of the overall network, which utilizes the linear complexity of SSM to achieve the capability of global context encoding. Simultaneously, the Direction-aware Scan Module (DSM) is designed to dynamically aggregate feature exchanges over different directional domains to effectively enhance the flexibility of sensing the spatially varying distribution of haze. In this way, our RSDhamba fully demonstrates the superiority of spatial distance capture dependencies and channel information exchange for better extraction of haze features. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks validate the surpassing performance of our RSDehamba against existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This article makes the first attempt to investigate the face retouching reversal (FRR) problem. We first collect an FRR dataset, named deepFRR, which contains 50,000 StyleGAN-generated high-resolution (1024*1024) facial images and their corresponding retouched ones by a commercial online API. To our best knowledge, deepFRR is the first FRR dataset tailored for training the deep FRR models. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-based FRR approach (FRRffusion) for the FRR task. Our FRRffusion consists of a coarse-to-fine two-stage network: A diffusion-based Facial Morpho-Architectonic Restorer (FMAR) is constructed to generate the basic contours of low-resolution faces in the first stage, while a Transformer-based Hyperrealistic Facial Detail Generator (HFDG) is designed to create high-resolution facial details in the second stage. Tested on deepFRR, our FRRffusion surpasses the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods by a large margin in four widespread quantitative metrics. Especially, the de-retouched images by our FRRffusion are visually much closer to the raw face images than both the retouched face images and those restored by the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods in terms of qualitative evaluation with 85 subjects.

| **[Uncertainty Visualization via Low-Dimensional Posterior Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07804v2)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ill-posed inverse problems, it is commonly desirable to obtain insight into the full spectrum of plausible solutions, rather than extracting only a single reconstruction. Information about the plausible solutions and their likelihoods is encoded in the posterior distribution. However, for high-dimensional data, this distribution is challenging to visualize. In this work, we introduce a new approach for estimating and visualizing posteriors by employing energy-based models (EBMs) over low-dimensional subspaces. Specifically, we train a conditional EBM that receives an input measurement and a set of directions that span some low-dimensional subspace of solutions, and outputs the probability density function of the posterior within that space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across a diverse range of datasets and image restoration problems, showcasing its strength in uncertainty quantification and visualization. As we show, our method outperforms a baseline that projects samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, while being orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, it is more accurate than a baseline that assumes a Gaussian posterior.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (RCOT) approach, which models image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for both unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a unique degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we first formalize a Fourier residual-guided OT objective by incorporating the degradation-specific information of the residual into the transport cost. We further design the transport map as a two-pass RCOT map that comprises a base model and a refinement process, in which the transport residual is computed by the base model in the first pass and then encoded as a degradation-specific embedding to condition the second-pass restoration. By duality, the RCOT problem is transformed into a minimax optimization problem, which can be solved by adversarially training neural networks. Extensive experiments on multiple restoration tasks show that RCOT achieves competitive performance in terms of both distortion measures and perceptual quality, restoring images with more faithful structures as compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

However, given the local nature of the convolutional operator, they struggle to capture global information. The promise of attention mechanisms in Transformers is to circumvent this problem, but it comes at the cost of intensive computational overhead. Many recent studies in image restoration have focused on solving the challenge of balancing performance and computational cost via Transformer variants. In this paper, we present CascadedGaze Network (CGNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that employs Global Context Extractor (GCE), a novel and efficient way to capture global information for image restoration. The GCE module leverages small kernels across convolutional layers to learn global dependencies, without requiring self-attention. Extensive experimental results show that our computationally efficient approach performs competitively to a range of state-of-the-art methods on synthetic image denoising and single image deblurring tasks, and pushes the performance boundary further on the real image denoising task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2024. 20 pages</p></details> |

| **[DocRes: A Generalist Model Toward Unifying Document Image Restoration Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04408v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document image restoration is a crucial aspect of Document AI systems, as the quality of document images significantly influences the overall performance. Prevailing methods address distinct restoration tasks independently, leading to intricate systems and the incapability to harness the potential synergies of multi-task learning. To overcome this challenge, we propose DocRes, a generalist model that unifies five document image restoration tasks including dewarping, deshadowing, appearance enhancement, deblurring, and binarization. To instruct DocRes to perform various restoration tasks, we propose a novel visual prompt approach called Dynamic Task-Specific Prompt (DTSPrompt). The DTSPrompt for different tasks comprises distinct prior features, which are additional characteristics extracted from the input image. Beyond its role as a cue for task-specific execution, DTSPrompt can also serve as supplementary information to enhance the model's performance. Moreover, DTSPrompt is more flexible than prior visual prompt approaches as it can be seamlessly applied and adapted to inputs with high and variable resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DocRes achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art task-specific models. This underscores the potential of DocRes across a broader spectrum of document image restoration tasks.

| **[UP-CrackNet: Unsupervised Pixel-Wise Road Crack Detection via Adversarial Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15647v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, automated methods have been developed to detect cracks more efficiently, accurately, and objectively, with the ultimate goal of replacing conventional manual visual inspection techniques. Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalizability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits satisfactory performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms.

| **[Deep Image Restoration For Image Anti-Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02751v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image forensics is concerned with whether an image has been tampered with, image anti-forensics attempts to prevent image forensics methods from detecting tampered images. The competition between these two fields started long before the advancement of deep learning. JPEG compression, blurring and noising, which are simple methods by today's standards, have long been used for anti-forensics and have been the subject of much research in both forensics and anti-forensics. Although these traditional methods are old, they make it difficult to detect fake images and are used for data augmentation in training deep image forgery detection models. In addition to making the image difficult to detect, these methods leave traces on the image and consequently degrade the image quality. Separate image forensics methods have also been developed to detect these traces. In this study, we go one step further and improve the image quality after these methods with deep image restoration models and make it harder to detect the forged image. We evaluate the impact of these methods on image quality. We then test both our proposed methods with deep learning and methods without deep learning on the two best existing image manipulation detection models. In the obtained results, we show how existing image forgery detection models fail against the proposed methods. Code implementation will be publicly available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIRFIAF .</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Satellites in 3D from Amateur Telescope Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18394v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a framework for the 3D reconstruction of satellites in low-Earth orbit, utilizing videos captured by small amateur telescopes. The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We proceed with the application of an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm for reconstructing the 3D model. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach using both synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Variational Network Toward Blind Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10796v6)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind image restoration (IR) is a common yet challenging problem in computer vision. Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI@2024.

| **[PromptCIR: Blind Compressed Image Restoration with Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17433v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind Compressed Image Restoration (CIR) has garnered significant attention due to its practical applications. It aims to mitigate compression artifacts caused by unknown quality factors, particularly with JPEG codecs. Existing works on blind CIR often seek assistance from a quality factor prediction network to facilitate their network to restore compressed images. However, the predicted numerical quality factor lacks spatial information, preventing network adaptability toward image contents. Recent studies in prompt-learning-based image restoration have showcased the potential of prompts to generalize across varied degradation types and degrees. This motivated us to design a prompt-learning-based compressed image restoration network, dubbed PromptCIR, which can effectively restore images from various compress levels. Specifically, PromptCIR exploits prompts to encode compression information implicitly, where prompts directly interact with soft weights generated from image features, thus providing dynamic content-aware and distortion-aware guidance for the restoration process. The light-weight prompts enable our method to adapt to different compression levels, while introducing minimal parameter overhead. Overall, PromptCIR leverages the powerful transformer-based backbone with the dynamic prompt module to proficiently handle blind CIR tasks, winning first place in the NTIRE 2024 challenge of blind compressed image enhancement track. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed PromptCIR. The code is available at https://github.com/lbc12345/PromptCIR-NTIRE24.</p></details> | <details><summary>Winne...</summary><p>Winner of NTIRE 2024 Blind Compressed Image Enhancement Challenge</p></details> |
| **[One-Shot Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17426v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration, or inverse problems in image processing, has long been an extensively studied topic. In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.</p></details> |  |

While optimizing downstream reward models has emerged as a promising alignment strategy, concerns arise regarding the risk of excessive optimization with learned reward models, which potentially compromises ground-truth performance. In this work, we confront the reward overoptimization problem in diffusion model alignment through the lenses of both inductive and primacy biases. We first identify a mismatch between current methods and the temporal inductive bias inherent in the multi-step denoising process of diffusion models, as a potential source of reward overoptimization. Then, we surprisingly discover that dormant neurons in our critic model act as a regularization against reward overoptimization while active neurons reflect primacy bias. Motivated by these observations, we propose Temporal Diffusion Policy Optimization with critic active neuron Reset (TDPO-R), a policy gradient algorithm that exploits the temporal inductive bias of diffusion models and mitigates the primacy bias stemming from active neurons. Empirical results demonstrate the superior efficacy of our methods in mitigating reward overoptimization.

Prior work has shown that these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the vision modality. These attacks can be leveraged to spread fake information or defraud users, and thus pose a significant risk, which makes the robustness of large multi-modal foundation models a pressing problem. The CLIP model, or one of its variants, is used as a frozen vision encoder in many large vision-language models (LVLMs), e.g. LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder, which yields robustness on all vision down-stream tasks (LVLMs, zero-shot classification) that rely on CLIP. In particular, we show that stealth-attacks on users of LVLMs by a malicious third party providing manipulated images are no longer possible once one replaces the original CLIP model with our robust one. No retraining or fine-tuning of the down-stream LVLMs is required. The code and robust models are available at https://github.com/chs20/RobustVLM</p></details> | ICML 2024 Oral |

However, their application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |

However, in this paper, we empirically find that the finer descriptions tend to align more effectively with local areas of the query image rather than the whole image, and then we theoretically validate this finding. Thus, we present a method called weighted visual-text cross alignment (WCA). This method begins with a localized visual prompting technique, designed to identify local visual areas within the query image. The local visual areas are then cross-aligned with the finer descriptions by creating a similarity matrix using the pre-trained VLM. To determine how well a query image aligns with each category, we develop a score function based on the weighted similarities in this matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves zero-shot performance across various datasets, achieving results that are even comparable to few-shot learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 16 figures, published to ICML 2024</p></details> |

Recent work has investigated both vision and language modalities for physical reasoning; vision can reveal information about objects in the environment and language serves as an abstraction and communication medium for additional context. Although these works have demonstrated success on a variety of physical reasoning tasks, they are limited to physical properties that can be inferred from visual or language inputs.

Arial photographs taken from small manned and unmanned aircraft can be available soon after a disaster and provide valuable information from multiple perspectives for situational awareness and damage assessment applications. However, emergency managers often face challenges finding the most relevant photos among the tens of thousands that may be taken after an incident. While ML-based solutions could enable more effective use of aerial photographs, there is still a lack of training data for imagery of this type from multiple perspectives and for multiple hazard types. To address this, we present the LADI v2 (Low Altitude Disaster Imagery version 2) dataset, a curated set of about 10,000 disaster images captured in the United States by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in response to federally-declared emergencies (2015-2023) and annotated for multi-label classification by trained CAP volunteers.

Nonetheless, spatial reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs remain unattested and underexplored. In this work, we thus study their capability to understand and reason over spatial relations from the top view. The focus on top view also enables controlled evaluations at different granularity of spatial reasoning; we clearly disentangle different abilities (e.g., recognizing particular objects versus understanding their relative positions). We introduce the TopViewRS (Top-View Reasoning in Space) dataset, consisting of 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either realistic or semantic top-view map as visual input. We then use it to study and evaluate VLMs across 4 perception and reasoning tasks with different levels of complexity. Evaluation of 10 representative open- and closed-source VLMs reveals the gap of more than 50% compared to average human performance, and it is even lower than the random baseline in some cases. Although additional experiments show that Chain-of-Thought reasoning can boost model capabilities by 5.82% on average, the overall performance of VLMs remains limited. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced model capability in top-view spatial reasoning and set a foundation for further research towards human-level proficiency of VLMs in real-world multimodal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables (21 pages, 4 figures, 15 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

However, leveraging this self-correction capability may not always be effective, as it has the potential to revise an initially correct response into an incorrect one. In this paper, we endeavor to understand how and why leveraging the self-correction capability is effective. We identify that appropriate instructions can guide LLMs to a convergence state, wherein additional self-correction steps do not yield further performance improvements. We empirically demonstrate that model uncertainty and activated latent concepts jointly characterize the effectiveness of self-correction. Furthermore, we provide a mathematical formulation indicating that the activated latent concept drives the convergence of the model uncertainty and self-correction performance. Our analysis can also be generalized to the self-correction behaviors observed in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Moreover, we highlight that task-agnostic debiasing can benefit from our principle in terms of selecting effective fine-tuning samples. Such initial success demonstrates the potential extensibility for better instruction tuning and safety alignment.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Radar Spectra-Language Model for Automotive Scene Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02158v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar sensors are low cost, long-range, and weather-resilient. Therefore, they are widely used for driver assistance functions, and are expected to be crucial for the success of autonomous driving in the future. In many perception tasks only pre-processed radar point clouds are considered. In contrast, radar spectra are a raw form of radar measurements and contain more information than radar point clouds. However, radar spectra are rather difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to explore the semantic information contained in spectra in the context of automated driving, thereby moving towards better interpretability of radar spectra. To this end, we create a radar spectra-language model, allowing us to query radar spectra measurements for the presence of scene elements using free text. We overcome the scarcity of radar spectra data by matching the embedding space of an existing vision-language model (VLM). Finally, we explore the benefit of the learned representation for scene parsing, and obtain improvements in free space segmentation and object detection merely by injecting the spectra embedding into a baseline model.</p></details> |  |

Notably, both visual cues and linguistic symbols in text-rich images play crucial roles in information transmission but are accompanied by diverse challenges. Therefore, the efficient and effective understanding of text-rich images is a crucial litmus test for the capability of Vision-Language Models. We have crafted an efficient vision-language model, StrucTexTv3, tailored to tackle various intelligent tasks for text-rich images. The significant design of StrucTexTv3 is presented in the following aspects: Firstly, we adopt a combination of an effective multi-scale reduced visual transformer and a multi-granularity token sampler (MG-Sampler) as a visual token generator, successfully solving the challenges of high-resolution input and complex representation learning for text-rich images. Secondly, we enhance the perception and comprehension abilities of StrucTexTv3 through instruction learning, seamlessly integrating various text-oriented tasks into a unified framework. Thirdly, we have curated a comprehensive collection of high-quality text-rich images, abbreviated as TIM-30M, encompassing diverse scenarios like incidental scenes, office documents, web pages, and screenshots, thereby improving the robustness of our model. Our method achieved SOTA results in text-rich image perception tasks, and significantly improved performance in comprehension tasks. Among multimodal models with LLM decoder of approximately 1.8B parameters, it stands out as a leader, which also makes the deployment of edge devices feasible. In summary, the StrucTexTv3 model, featuring efficient structural design, outstanding performance, and broad adaptability, offers robust support for diverse intelligent application tasks involving text-rich images, thus exhibiting immense potential for widespread application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable and Principled Efficiency for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07448v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success of pre-trained foundation vision-language models makes Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) possible. Despite the promising performance, this approach introduces heavy computational overheads for two challenges: 1) large model sizes of the backbone; 2) expensive costs during the fine-tuning. These challenges hinder this OVS strategy from being widely applicable and affordable in real-world scenarios. Although traditional methods such as model compression and efficient fine-tuning can address these challenges, they often rely on heuristics. This means that their solutions cannot be easily transferred and necessitate re-training on different models, which comes at a cost. In the context of efficient OVS, we target achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than prior OVS works based on large vision-language foundation models, by utilizing smaller models that incur lower training costs. The core strategy is to make our efficiency principled and thus seamlessly transferable from one OVS framework to others without further customization. Comprehensive experiments on diverse OVS benchmarks demonstrate our superior trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computation costs over previous works.

| **[HPE-CogVLM: New Head Pose Grounding Task Exploration on Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01914v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Head pose estimation (HPE) task requires a sophisticated understanding of 3D spatial relationships and precise numerical output of yaw, pitch, and roll Euler angles. Previous HPE studies are mainly based on Non-large language models (Non-LLMs), which rely on close-up human heads cropped from the full image as inputs and lack robustness in real-world scenario. In this paper, we present a novel framework to enhance the HPE prediction task by leveraging the visual grounding capability of CogVLM. CogVLM is a vision language model (VLM) with grounding capability of predicting object bounding boxes (BBoxes), which enables HPE training and prediction using full image information input. To integrate the HPE task into the VLM, we first cop with the catastrophic forgetting problem in large language models (LLMs) by investigating the rehearsal ratio in the data rehearsal method. Then, we propose and validate a LoRA layer-based model merging method, which keeps the integrity of parameters, to enhance the HPE performance in the framework. The results show our HPE-CogVLM achieves a 31.5\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error for HPE prediction over the current Non-LLM based state-of-the-art in cross-dataset evaluation. Furthermore, we compare our LoRA layer-based model merging method with LoRA fine-tuning only and other merging methods in CogVLM. The results demonstrate our framework outperforms them in all HPE metrics.</p></details> |  |

We present TransCLIP, a novel and computationally efficient transductive approach designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). TransCLIP is applicable as a plug-and-play module on top of popular inductive zero- and few-shot models, consistently improving their performances. Our new objective function can be viewed as a regularized maximum-likelihood estimation, constrained by a KL divergence penalty that integrates the text-encoder knowledge and guides the transductive learning process. We further derive an iterative Block Majorize-Minimize (BMM) procedure for optimizing our objective, with guaranteed convergence and decoupled sample-assignment updates, yielding computationally efficient transduction for large-scale datasets. We report comprehensive evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies that demonstrate: (i) Transduction can greatly enhance the generalization capabilities of inductive pretrained zero- and few-shot VLMs; (ii) TransCLIP substantially outperforms standard transductive few-shot learning methods relying solely on vision features, notably due to the KL-based language constraint.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of vision language models has sparked an increase in demands for sharing reports linked to CheXpert images, along with a growing interest among AI fairness researchers in obtaining demographic data. To address this, CheXpert Plus serves as a new collection of radiology data sources, made publicly available to enhance the scaling, performance, robustness, and fairness of models for all subsequent machine learning tasks in the field of radiology. CheXpert Plus is the largest text dataset publicly released in radiology, with a total of 36 million text tokens, including 13 million impression tokens. To the best of our knowledge, it represents the largest text de-identification effort in radiology, with almost 1 million PHI spans anonymized. It is only the second time that a large-scale English paired dataset has been released in radiology, thereby enabling, for the first time, cross-institution training at scale. All reports are paired with high-quality images in DICOM format, along with numerous image and patient metadata covering various clinical and socio-economic groups, as well as many pathology labels and RadGraph annotations. We hope this dataset will boost research for AI models that can further assist radiologists and help improve medical care.

However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks.

| **[SLANT: Spurious Logo ANalysis Toolkit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01449v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online content is filled with logos, from ads and social media posts to website branding and product placements. Consequently, these logos are prevalent in the extensive web-scraped datasets used to pretrain Vision-Language Models, which are used for a wide array of tasks (content moderation, object classification). While these models have been shown to learn harmful correlations in various tasks, whether these correlations include logos remains understudied. Understanding this is especially important due to logos often being used by public-facing entities like brands and government agencies. To that end, we develop SLANT: A Spurious Logo ANalysis Toolkit. Our key finding is that some logos indeed lead to spurious incorrect predictions, for example, adding the Adidas logo to a photo of a person causes a model classify the person as greedy. SLANT contains a semi-automatic mechanism for mining such "spurious" logos. The mechanism consists of a comprehensive logo bank, CC12M-LogoBank, and an algorithm that searches the bank for logos that VLMs spuriously correlate with a user-provided downstream recognition target. We uncover various seemingly harmless logos that VL models correlate 1) with negative human adjectives 2) with the concept of `harmlessness'; causing models to misclassify harmful online content as harmless, and 3) with user-provided object concepts; causing lower recognition accuracy on ImageNet zero-shot classification. Furthermore, SLANT's logos can be seen as effective attacks against foundational models; an attacker could place a spurious logo on harmful content, causing the model to misclassify it as harmless. This threat is alarming considering the simplicity of logo attacks, increasing the attack surface of VL models. As a defense, we include in our Toolkit two effective mitigation strategies that seamlessly integrate with zero-shot inference of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ED-SAM: An Efficient Diffusion Sampling Approach to Domain Generalization in Vision-Language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01432v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-Language Foundation Model has recently shown outstanding performance in various perception learning tasks. The outstanding performance of the vision-language model mainly relies on large-scale pre-training datasets and different data augmentation techniques. However, the domain generalization problem of the vision-language foundation model needs to be addressed. This problem has limited the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model to unknown data distributions. In this paper, we introduce a new simple but efficient Diffusion Sampling approach to Domain Generalization (ED-SAM) to improve the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model. Our theoretical analysis in this work reveals the critical role and relation of the diffusion model to domain generalization in the vision-language foundation model. Then, based on the insightful analysis, we introduce a new simple yet effective Transport Transformation to diffusion sampling method. It can effectively generate adversarial samples to improve the generalizability of the foundation model against unknown data distributions. The experimental results on different scales of vision-language pre-training datasets, including CC3M, CC12M, and LAION400M, have consistently shown State-of-the-Art performance and scalability of the proposed ED-SAM approach compared to the other recent methods.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy. The benchmark ComTQA has been open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance/ComTQA. The source code and model will be released later.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Despite the progress made in designing efficient fine-tuning methods, such methods require access to the model's parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes a \textbf{C}ollabo\textbf{ra}tive \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CraFT}) approach for fine-tuning black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules, a prompt generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm. Extensive experiments on few-shot classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about 12\% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing only 1.62\% compared to the white-box method.

Most existing zero-shot OOD detectors rely on ID class label-based prompts to guide CLIP in classifying ID images and rejecting OOD images. In this work we instead propose to leverage a large set of diverse auxiliary outlier class labels as pseudo OOD class text prompts to CLIP for enhancing zero-shot OOD detection, an approach we called Outlier Label Exposure (OLE). The key intuition is that ID images are expected to have lower similarity to these outlier class prompts than OOD images. One issue is that raw class labels often include noise labels, e.g., synonyms of ID labels, rendering raw OLE-based detection ineffective. To address this issue, we introduce an outlier prototype learning module that utilizes the prompt embeddings of the outlier labels to learn a small set of pivotal outlier prototypes for an embedding similarity-based OOD scoring. Additionally, the outlier classes and their prototypes can be loosely coupled with the ID classes, leading to an inseparable decision region between them. Thus, we also introduce an outlier label generation module that synthesizes our outlier prototypes and ID class embeddings to generate in-between outlier prototypes to further calibrate the detection in OLE. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments show that OLE substantially improves detection performance and achieves new state-of-the-art performance in large-scale OOD and hard OOD detection benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN2024, 8 pages</p></details> |

However, mitigating the performance degradation in large-scale models is non-trivial due to (i) parameter shifts throughout lifelong learning and (ii) significant computational burdens associated with full-model tuning. In this work, we present a parameter-efficient continual learning framework to alleviate long-term forgetting in incremental learning with vision-language models. Our approach involves the dynamic expansion of a pre-trained CLIP model, through the integration of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) adapters in response to new tasks. To preserve the zero-shot recognition capability of vision-language models, we further introduce a Distribution Discriminative Auto-Selector (DDAS) that automatically routes in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs to the MoE Adapter and the original CLIP, respectively. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our proposed method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches while concurrently reducing parameter training burdens by 60%.

Conventional methods address this issue by utilizing large datasets to extract rich representations for IQA. Also, some approaches propose vision language models (VLM) based IQA, but the domain gap between generic VLM and IQA constrains their scalability. In this work, we propose a novel pretraining framework that constructs a generalizable representation for IQA by selectively extracting quality-related knowledge from VLM and leveraging the scalability of large datasets. Specifically, we carefully select optimal text prompts for five representative image quality attributes and use VLM to generate pseudo-labels. Numerous attribute-aware pseudo-labels can be generated with large image datasets, allowing our IQA model to learn rich representations about image quality. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple IQA datasets and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities. Leveraging these strengths, we propose several applications, such as evaluating image generation models and training image enhancement models, demonstrating our model's real-world applicability. We will make the code available for access.</p></details> |  |

The VLMs, which process image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper, we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing.

However, these models still struggle with fine-grained object-level understanding and grounding. In terms of modeling, existing VLMs implicitly align text tokens with image patch tokens, which is ineffective for embedding alignment at the same granularity and inevitably introduces noisy spurious background features. Additionally, these models struggle when generalizing to unseen visual concepts and may not be reliable for domain-specific tasks without further fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method to prompt large language models with in-context visual object vectors, thereby enabling controllable object-level reasoning. This eliminates the necessity of fusing a lengthy array of image patch features and significantly speeds up training. Furthermore, we propose region-level retrieval using our object representations, facilitating rapid adaptation to new objects without additional training. Our experiments reveal that our method achieves competitive referring object classification and captioning performance, while also offering zero-shot generalization and robustness to visually challenging contexts.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |

Our findings reveal that the image understanding capabilities of current VLMs are strongly correlated with their zero-shot performance on vision language (VL) tasks. This suggests that prioritizing basic image understanding is crucial for VLMs to excel at VL tasks. To enhance object-level image understanding, we propose Crayon Large Language and Vision mOdel (CoLLaVO), which incorporates instruction tuning with Crayon Prompt as a new visual prompt tuning scheme based on panoptic color maps.

Zero-shot OOD detection, requiring no training on in-distribution (ID) data, has been possible with the advent of vision-language models like CLIP. Existing methods build a text-based classifier with only closed-set labels. However, this largely restricts the inherent capability of CLIP to recognize samples from large and open label space. In this paper, we propose to tackle this constraint by leveraging the expert knowledge and reasoning capability of large language models (LLM) to Envision potential Outlier Exposure, termed EOE, without access to any actual OOD data. Owing to better adaptation to open-world scenarios, EOE can be generalized to different tasks, including far, near, and fine-grained OOD detection. Technically, we design (1) LLM prompts based on visual similarity to generate potential outlier class labels specialized for OOD detection, as well as (2) a new score function based on potential outlier penalty to distinguish hard OOD samples effectively. Empirically, EOE achieves state-of-the-art performance across different OOD tasks and can be effectively scaled to the ImageNet-1K dataset.

However, their ability to interpret abstract figures, such as geometry shapes and scientific plots, remains limited due to a scarcity of training datasets in scientific domains. To fill this gap, we introduce Multimodal ArXiv, consisting of ArXivCap and ArXivQA, for enhancing LVLMs scientific comprehension. ArXivCap is a figure-caption dataset comprising 6.4M images and 3.9M captions, sourced from 572K ArXiv papers spanning various scientific domains. Drawing from ArXivCap, we introduce ArXivQA, a question-answering dataset generated by prompting GPT-4V based on scientific figures. ArXivQA greatly enhances open-sourced LVLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities, achieving a 10.4\% absolute accuracy gain on a multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, employing ArXivCap, we devise four vision-to-text tasks for benchmarking LVLMs. Evaluation results with state-of-the-art LVLMs underscore their struggle with the nuanced semantics of academic figures, while domain-specific training yields substantial performance gains. Our error analysis uncovers misinterpretations of visual context, recognition errors, and the production of overly simplified captions by current LVLMs, shedding light on future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mm-arxiv.github.io, Camera Ready Version of ACL 2024</p></details> |

A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method, which employs a sophisticated algorithm to accurately detect and separate images and their corresponding textual descriptions from PDF documents, such as scientific papers. The method includes a careful refinement of image-text pairs through integrated vision and language processing, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant, and well reasoned training data. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data extracted from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia pages demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports complex natural language understanding in an integrated model, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-image or image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To explore the development of larger models from smaller ones, we report both mixture-of-expert methods and model merging. These hybrid approaches allow us to leverage the domain-specific expertise and general conversational capabilities to harness the strengths of multiple models. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior.

However, we find that directly aggregating the multi-level visual features weakens the zero-shot ability for novel classes. The large differences between the visual features from different layers make these features hard to align well with the text embeddings. We resolve this problem by introducing a series of independent decoders to align the multi-level visual features with the text embeddings in a cascaded way, forming a novel but simple framework named Cascade-CLIP. Our Cascade-CLIP is flexible and can be easily applied to existing zero-shot semantic segmentation methods. Experimental results show that our simple Cascade-CLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance on segmentation benchmarks, like COCO-Stuff, Pascal-VOC, and Pascal-Context.

In this work, we introduce a video question answering dataset SuperCLEVR-Physics that focuses on the dynamics properties of objects. We concentrate on physical concepts -- velocity, acceleration, and collisions within 4D scenes, where the model needs to fully understand these dynamics properties and answer the questions built on top of them. From the evaluation of a variety of current VLMs, we find that these models struggle with understanding these dynamic properties due to the lack of explicit knowledge about the spatial structure in 3D and world dynamics in time variants. To demonstrate the importance of an explicit 4D dynamics representation of the scenes in understanding world dynamics, we further propose NS-4Dynamics, a Neural-Symbolic model for reasoning on 4D Dynamics properties under explicit scene representation from videos. Using scene rendering likelihood combining physical prior distribution, the 4D scene parser can estimate the dynamics properties of objects over time to and interpret the observation into 4D scene representation as world states. By further incorporating neural-symbolic reasoning, our approach enables advanced applications in future prediction, factual reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning. Our experiments show that our NS-4Dynamics suppresses previous VLMs in understanding the dynamics properties and answering questions about factual queries, future prediction, and counterfactual reasoning. Moreover, based on the explicit 4D scene representation, our model is effective in reconstructing the 4D scenes and re-simulate the future or counterfactual events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Sole Strength: Customized Ensembles for Generalized Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17091v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, for the open-world generalization has gained increasing popularity due to its practical value. However, performance advancements are limited when relying solely on intricate algorithmic designs for a single model, even one exhibiting strong performance, e.g., CLIP-ViT-B/16. This paper, for the first time, explores the collaborative potential of leveraging much weaker VLMs to enhance the generalization of a robust single model. The affirmative findings motivate us to address the generalization problem from a novel perspective, i.e., ensemble of pre-trained VLMs. We introduce three customized ensemble strategies, each tailored to one specific scenario. Firstly, we introduce the zero-shot ensemble, automatically adjusting the logits of different models based on their confidence when only pre-trained VLMs are available. Furthermore, for scenarios with extra few-shot samples, we propose the training-free and tuning ensemble, offering flexibility based on the availability of computing resources. The proposed ensemble strategies are evaluated on zero-shot, base-to-new, and cross-dataset generalization, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, this work represents an initial stride toward enhancing the generalization performance of VLMs via ensemble.

However, in resource-constrained regions like Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), limited access to GPUs and data poses significant challenges, often leaving CPUs as the sole resource. To address this, we advocate for leveraging vector embeddings to enable flexible and efficient computational methodologies, democratizing multimodal deep learning across diverse contexts. Our paper investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of using vector embeddings from single-modal foundation models and multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multimodal deep learning in low-resource environments, particularly in healthcare. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective inference-time method to enhance performance by aligning image-text embeddings. Comparing these approaches with traditional methods, we assess their impact on computational efficiency and model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, inference time, training time, and memory usage across three medical modalities: BRSET (ophthalmology), HAM10000 (dermatology), and SatelliteBench (public health). Our findings show that embeddings reduce computational demands without compromising model performance. Furthermore, our alignment method improves performance in medical tasks. This research promotes sustainable AI practices by optimizing resources in constrained environments, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches for efficient multimodal learning. Vector embeddings democratize multimodal deep learning in LMICs, particularly in healthcare, enhancing AI adaptability in varied use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Rank Few-Shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18541v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in the few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has further pushed their generalization capabilities, at the expense of just a few labeled samples within the target downstream task. However, this promising, already quite abundant few-shot literature has focused principally on prompt learning and, to a lesser extent, on adapters, overlooking the recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Furthermore, existing few-shot learning methods for VLMs often rely on heavy training procedures and/or carefully chosen, task-specific hyper-parameters, which might impede their applicability. In response, we introduce Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in few-shot learning for VLMs, and show its potential on 11 datasets, in comparison to current state-of-the-art prompt- and adapter-based approaches. Surprisingly, our simple CLIP-LoRA method exhibits substantial improvements, while reducing the training times and keeping the same hyper-parameters in all the target tasks, i.e., across all the datasets and numbers of shots. Certainly, our surprising results do not dismiss the potential of prompt-learning and adapter-based research. However, we believe that our strong baseline could be used to evaluate progress in these emergent subjects in few-shot VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances leverage knowledge distillation to transfer insightful knowledge from pre-trained large-scale vision-language models to the task of object detection, significantly generalizing the powerful capabilities of the detector to identify more unknown object categories. However, these methods face significant challenges in background interpretation and model overfitting and thus often result in the loss of crucial background knowledge, giving rise to sub-optimal inference performance of the detector. To mitigate these issues, we present a novel OVD framework termed LBP to propose learning background prompts to harness explored implicit background knowledge, thus enhancing the detection performance w.r.t. base and novel categories. Specifically, we devise three modules: Background Category-specific Prompt, Background Object Discovery, and Inference Probability Rectification, to empower the detector to discover, represent, and leverage implicit object knowledge explored from background proposals. Evaluation on two benchmark datasets, OV-COCO and OV-LVIS, demonstrates the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches in handling the OVD tasks.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |

We leverage large scale Vision Language Models like CLIP to enable real time adaptation on a per-image basis without access to source data or ground truth labels. Since the deployed model can also encounter unseen classes in an open world, we first employ a simple and effective Out of Distribution (OOD) detection module to distinguish between weak and strong OOD samples. We propose a novel contrastive learning based objective to enhance the discriminability between weak and strong OOD samples by utilizing small, dynamically updated feature banks. Finally, we also employ a classification objective for adapting the model using the reliable weak OOD samples. The proposed framework ROSITA combines these components, enabling continuous online adaptation of Vision Language Models on a single image basis. Extensive experimentation on diverse domain adaptation benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in defining reward signals for teaching robots manipulation skills. However, existing works often provide reward guidance that is too coarse, leading to inefficient learning processes. In this paper, we address this issue by implementing more fine-grained reward guidance. We decompose tasks into simpler sub-tasks, using this decomposition to offer more informative reward guidance with VLMs. We also propose a VLM-based self imitation learning process to speed up learning. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our algorithm consistently outperforms baselines such as CLIP, LIV, and RoboCLIP. Specifically, our algorithm achieves a $5.4 \times$ higher average success rate compared to the best baseline, RoboCLIP, across a series of manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Their performance can be further enhanced through few-shot prompt tuning methods. However, current studies evaluate the performance of learned prompts separately on base and new classes. This evaluation lacks practicality for real-world applications since downstream tasks cannot determine whether the data belongs to base or new classes in advance. In this paper, we explore a problem setting called Open-world Prompt Tuning (OPT), which involves tuning prompts on base classes and evaluating on a combination of base and new classes. By introducing Decomposed Prompt Tuning framework (DePT), we theoretically demonstrate that OPT can be solved by incorporating out-of-distribution detection into prompt tuning, thereby enhancing the base-to-new discriminability. Based on DePT, we present a novel prompt tuning approach, namely, Decomposed Context Optimization (DeCoOp), which introduces new-class detectors and sub-classifiers to further enhance the base-class and new-class discriminability. Experimental results on 11 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of DePT and demonstrate that DeCoOp outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, providing a significant 2% average accuracy improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024.

An Extensive Investigation into the Capabilities and Limitations of LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00257v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language is a powerful complementary modality of communication for data visualizations, such as bar and line charts. To facilitate chart-based reasoning using natural language, various downstream tasks have been introduced recently such as chart question answering, chart summarization, and fact-checking with charts. These tasks pose a unique challenge, demanding both vision-language reasoning and a nuanced understanding of chart data tables, visual encodings, and natural language prompts. Despite the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse NLP tasks, their abilities and limitations in the realm of data visualization remain under-explored, possibly due to their lack of multi-modal capabilities. To bridge the gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the recently developed large vision language models (LVLMs) for chart understanding and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation includes a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs, including GPT-4V and Gemini, across four major chart reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative evaluation of LVLMs' performance on a diverse range of charts, aiming to provide a thorough analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings reveal that LVLMs demonstrate impressive abilities in generating fluent texts covering high-level data insights while also encountering common problems like hallucinations, factual errors, and data bias. We highlight the key strengths and limitations of chart comprehension tasks, offering insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

While the fundamental architecture and pre-training methods of vision encoders and LLMs have been extensively studied, the architecture and training strategy of vision-language adapters vary significantly across recent works. Our research undertakes a thorough exploration of the state-of-the-art perceiver resampler architecture and builds a strong baseline. However, we observe that the vision-language alignment with perceiver resampler exhibits slow convergence and limited scalability with a lack of direct supervision. To address this issue, we propose PaLM2-VAdapter, employing a progressively aligned language model as the vision-language adapter. Compared to the strong baseline with perceiver resampler, our method empirically shows faster convergence, higher performance, and stronger scalability. Extensive experiments across various Visual Question Answering (VQA) and captioning tasks on both images and videos demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art visual understanding and multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Notably, our method achieves these advancements with 30~70% fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art large vision-language models, marking a significant efficiency improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, 15 pages; v2 fix typos, add additional results in appendix</p></details> |
| **[Calibrated Self-Rewarding Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14622v3)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix s...</summary><p>fix some typos and add acknowledgement section in V3</p></details> |

Although the application of RAG with language-only models has been extensively explored, its adaptation into multimodal vision-language models remains nascent. Going beyond mere answer generation, the primary goal of multimodal RAG is to cultivate the models' ability to reason in response to relevant queries. To this end, we introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework named RMR (Retrieval Meets Reasoning). The RMR framework employs a bi-modal retrieval module to identify the most relevant question-answer pairs, which then serve as scaffolds for the multimodal reasoning process. This training-free approach not only encourages the model to engage deeply with the reasoning processes inherent in the retrieved content but also facilitates the generation of answers that are precise and richly interpretable. Surprisingly, utilizing solely the ScienceQA dataset, collected from elementary and high school science curricula, RMR significantly boosts the performance of various vision-language models across a spectrum of benchmark datasets, including A-OKVQA, MMBench, and SEED. These outcomes highlight the substantial potential of our multimodal retrieval and reasoning mechanism to improve the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite the powerful capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) in processing complex visual scenes, precisely recognizing obscured or ambiguously presented visual elements remains challenging. To tackle such issues, this paper proposes InsightSee, a multi-agent framework to enhance VLMs' interpretative capabilities in handling complex visual understanding scenarios. The framework comprises a description agent, two reasoning agents, and a decision agent, which are integrated to refine the process of visual information interpretation. The design of these agents and the mechanisms by which they can be enhanced in visual information processing are presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the InsightSee framework not only boosts performance on specific visual tasks but also retains the original models' strength. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in 6 out of 9 benchmark tests, with a substantial advancement in multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

Despite their success, accurately capturing user intentions with these models still requires a laborious trial and error process. This challenge is commonly identified as a model alignment problem, an issue that has attracted considerable attention by the research community. Instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models to steer image generation, in this work we present a novel method that relies on an information-theoretic alignment measure. In a nutshell, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on point-wise mutual information between prompts and images to define a synthetic training set to induce model alignment. Our comparative analysis shows that our method is on-par or superior to the state-of-the-art, yet requires nothing but a pre-trained denoising network to estimate MI and a lightweight fine-tuning strategy.</p></details> |  |

This development has led to the exploration of automated image description generation for multi-modal clinical scans, particularly for radiology report generation. Existing research has focused on clinical descriptions for specific modalities or body regions, leaving a gap for a model providing entire-body multi-modal descriptions. In this paper, we address this gap by automating the generation of standardized body station(s) and list of organ(s) across the whole body in multi-modal MR and CT radiological images. Leveraging the versatility of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), we refine and augment the existing approach through multiple experiments, including baseline model fine-tuning, adding station(s) as a superset for better correlation between organs, along with image and language augmentations.

| **[Benchmarking and Improving Detail Image Caption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19092v3)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning has long been regarded as a fundamental task in visual understanding. Recently, however, few large vision-language model (LVLM) research discusses model's image captioning performance because of the outdated short-caption benchmarks and unreliable evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose to benchmark detail image caption task by curating high-quality evaluation datasets annotated by human experts, GPT-4V and Gemini-1.5-Pro. We also design a more reliable caption evaluation metric called CAPTURE (CAPtion evaluation by exTracting and coUpling coRE information). CAPTURE extracts visual elements, e.g., objects, attributes and relations from captions, and then matches these elements through three stages, achieving the highest consistency with expert judgements over other rule-based or model-based caption metrics. The proposed benchmark and metric provide reliable evaluation for LVLM's detailed image captioning ability. Guided by this evaluation, we further explore to unleash LVLM's detail caption capabilities by synthesizing high-quality data through a five-stage data construction pipeline. Our pipeline only uses a given LVLM itself and other open-source tools, without any human or GPT-4V annotation in the loop. Experiments show that the proposed data construction strategy significantly improves model-generated detail caption data quality for LVLMs with leading performance, and the data quality can be further improved in a self-looping paradigm. All code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/foundation-multimodal-models/CAPTURE.</p></details> |  |

One major safety measure is to proactively test the LLMs with jailbreaks prior to the release. Therefore, such testing will require a method that can generate jailbreaks massively and efficiently. In this paper, we follow a novel yet intuitive strategy to generate jailbreaks in the style of the human generation. We propose a role-playing system that assigns four different roles to the user LLMs to collaborate on new jailbreaks. Furthermore, we collect existing jailbreaks and split them into different independent characteristics using clustering frequency and semantic patterns sentence by sentence. We organize these characteristics into a knowledge graph, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve. Our system of different roles will leverage this knowledge graph to generate new jailbreaks, which have proved effective in inducing LLMs to generate unethical or guideline-violating responses. In addition, we also pioneer a setting in our system that will automatically follow the government-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow the guidelines accordingly. We refer to our system as GUARD (Guideline Upholding through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics). We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a widely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT). Moreover, our work extends to the realm of vision language models (MiniGPT-v2 and Gemini Vision Pro), showcasing GUARD's versatility and contributing valuable insights for the development of safer, more reliable LLM-based applications across diverse modalities.</p></details> | 28 papges |

Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs. Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities. To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images. Specifically, we present LVLMs with identical open-ended text prompts while conditioning on images from different counterfactual sets, where each set contains images which are largely identical in their depiction of a common subject (e.g., a doctor), but vary only in terms of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race and gender). We comprehensively evaluate the text produced by different models under this counterfactual generation setting at scale, producing over 57 million responses from popular LVLMs. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals that social attributes such as race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in input images can significantly influence the generation of toxic content, competency-associated words, harmful stereotypes, and numerical ratings of depicted individuals. We additionally explore the relationship between social bias in LVLMs and their corresponding LLMs, as well as inference-time strategies to mitigate bias.</p></details> |  |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (1 expert). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures DISTS, FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture.

We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Photoacoustic image synthesis with generative adversarial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15510v3)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties with high spatial resolution. However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |
| **[Semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images using deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09624v3)** | 2022-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has the potential to revolutionize functional medical imaging in healthcare due to the valuable information on tissue physiology contained in multispectral photoacoustic measurements. Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Classification of Neuromuscular Diseases in Children Using Photoacoustic Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11630v1)** | 2022-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) cause a significant burden for both healthcare systems and society. They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |
| **[Fourier Neural Operator Networks: A Fast and General Solver for the Photoacoustic Wave Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09374v1)** | 2021-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation tools for photoacoustic wave propagation have played a key role in advancing photoacoustic imaging by providing quantitative and qualitative insights into parameters affecting image quality. Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
